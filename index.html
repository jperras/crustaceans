<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Previously I wrote about pedestrian/bike improvements for the east side of 101.
There's now a proposal for the east side exit of 101, shown in this slide at
a recent Caltrain board meeting.</p>
<img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/caltrain-board-meetnig.png" />
<p>It's not ideal to have pedestrians and cyclists on the north side of East Grand
for two reasons: ped/bike crossings will hold up shuttles merging onto East
Grand, and peds/bikes have to go out of the way up to the East Grand/Grand
intersection and then cross two signals - one with a 30 second wait time and
the other with a 42 second wait time. If one of the sidewalks in that photo is
supposed to be a bike path, it's currently in poor shape and it's not clear
there are plans to repair the surface.</p>
<img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/bike-lane-not-really.jpg" />
<p>It's pretty easy to imagine instead that cyclists will try to get across 2-3
lanes of traffic here, instead of waiting for two WALK signs at East Grand:</p>
<img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/bike-ramp-exit-how.png" />
<p>In an ideal world, bikes/peds could just cut straight across to the Gateway/East
Grand intersection like this. This would cut at least a minute off of pedestrian
travel times and extend the walkshed that much further. I believe SSF owns the
right of way where the bottom red line is located.</p>
<img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/proposed-route-vs-good-route.png" />
<p>Could SSF, Caltrans, and SamTrans staff advocate for a ped/bike crossing on
the south side of East Grand, that would allow ped/bike to travel on the south
side of the intersection, saving a circuitous route for bikes and pedestrians?
Ultimately this will require a decision that it's more important to prioritize
Caltrain riders, even if it means a slightly longer delay for car traffic.</p>
<p>The city of South San Francisco is the ultimate decision maker here, but they
would appreciate your input on good design outside the station area. Contact
the City Council: council@ssf.net and the Bike/Pedestrian Advisory Committee:
BPAC@ssf.net.</p></div>

<p>There is a group of software engineering researchers that don&#8217;t feature as often as I would like in my <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR">evidence-based software engineering</a> book; academics working in business schools.</p>
<p>Business school academics have written some of the best papers I have read on software engineering; the catch is that the data they use is confidential.  For somebody writing a book that only discusses a topic if there is data publicly available, this is a problem.</p>
<p>These business school researchers show that it is possible for academics to obtain &#8216;interesting&#8217; software engineering data from industry.  My experience with talking to researchers in computing departments is that most are too involved in their own algorithmic bubble to want to talk to anybody else.</p>
<p>One big difference between the data analysis papers written by academics in computing departments and business schools, is statistical sophistication.  Computing papers are still using <del datetime="2018-09-11T10:09:14+00:00">stone-age</del> pre-computer age techniques, the business papers use a wide range of sophisticated techniques (sometimes cutting edge).</p>
<p>There is one aspect of software engineering papers written by business school researchers that grates with me, many of the authors obviously don&#8217;t understand software engineering from a developer&#8217;s perspective; well, obviously, they are business oriented people.</p>
<p>The person who has done the largest amount of interesting software engineering research, whose work I don&#8217;t (yet; I will find a way) discuss, is <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ckemerer/kemerer.htm">Chris Kemerer</a>; a researcher who has a long list of <a href="http://www.pitt.edu/~ckemerer/Research.htm">empirical papers</a> going back to the late 1980s, and rarely gets cited by papers by people in computing departments (I am the only person I know, who limits themself to papers where the data is publicly available).</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/railway-suicide-research-caltrain/">Research on railway suicides and steps Caltrain could take</a>

<span class="date">September 11, 2018 05:22 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>It's Rail Safety Month and last month at the <a href="http://www.caltrain.com/about/advisorycommittees/cac.html">Caltrain CAC</a> we got a
presentation on suicides on the Caltrain line. I've <a href="https://github.com/kevinburke/caltrain-cac/tree/master/suicide-prevention">added some key papers that
study railway suicide to this Github repository</a>. At a high level, they
show:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>There are several factors that predict suicide incidence.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>There are several factors that have been demonstrated to reduce suicide
incidence.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Together these suggest that Caltrain may be able to take steps to reduce the
incidence of suicide. Caltrain has no dedicated source of funding, and staff
time is extremely valuable, so it's understandable that this hasn't been a focus
area, and it's also extremely likely that it won't be possible to make
improvements in these areas for some time.</p>
<h3>What factors predict suicide?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Psychopathy/psychiatric hospitalization.</em> An above average number of victims
have a documented psychiatric history.</p>
<p>One paper suggests that track areas near psychiatric facilities are higher
risk areas for attempted suicides. We could map Caltrain's passenger strikes
against psych facilities on the Peninsula corridor, and invest in fencing in
those areas.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Easy access to train tracks:</em> In many cases railway suicide attempts are
impulsive and not very well thought out. &quot;24% of the people who made near-lethal
suicide attempts took less than 5 min between the decision to kill themselves
and the actual attempt, and 70% less than 1 h,&quot; according to Miller and Hemenway
(2008).</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Frequency of train service:</em> The more trains that run the more suicides there
are. This is a risk factor for electrification, which plans to increase rail
frequency.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Knowing someone who has committed suicide:</em> there is a contagion effect where
one suicide may lead to others; either sensational coverage of a suicide or a
community member committing suicide may prompt copy cats.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What are the costs of suicide?</h3>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Loss of life:</em> Branches of government like the US DOT <a href="https://www.transportation.gov/sites/dot.gov/files/docs/VSL%20Guidance%202008%20and%202009rev.pdf">assign a statistical
value between $5 million and $10 million to a single life</a> when
evaluating safety improvements. This suggests an investment of $3-4 million in
railway safety is a net positive if it saves a single life.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Loss of railway service:</em> Train strikes frequently result in death, and
trains cannot begin moving again until a coroner can come on site to evaluate
the cause of death. This can result in delays of several hours. This results in
lost revenue — commuters may choose not to ride the train if the arrival
time is unpredictable — and lost productivity from missed meetings, work
time and so forth.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Employee trauma:</em> The psychological effects of striking people on the railway
have not been as well studied, but some drivers experience severe reactions to
striking people. This increases the cost of hiring and trauma management.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<h3>What measures can prevent suicide?</h3>
<p>Highly effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Platform Screen Doors:</em> Subways in Singapore and Hong Kong saw a significant
reduction in suicides - 59% - after installing screen doors at some stations.
Suicides did not increase at other stations without screen doors, either,
which fits with a characterization that suicide is an impulsive behavior, and
deterring people with a suicidal impulse is enough to lower total rates of
suicide.</p>
<p>Tasha Bartholomew suggested that on the Caltrain line about half of suicides
occur in station areas and half do not. The requirement to have freight
traffic on the corridor and potential FRA regulations around such may also
make it impossible to add platform screen doors. Still, we could evaluate
the possibility of platform doors at new stations or identified hotspots.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>Media Training:</em> Between 1984 and 1987 there was dramatic coverage of subway
suicides in Austria and a corresponding spike in suicides. In 1987 a group
developed media guidelines for suicide coverage and the suicide rate promptly
dropped by 80%. Suicide rates by other means also declined suggesting no
substitution.</p>
<p>Media coverage is more likely to lead to suicides when:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Lurid details about the method are provided</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>The more it's reported as being inconceivable (&quot;he had everything he could
have wanted&quot;)</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it's reported as having a romantic motive</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>If it's on the front page, the word suicide is in the headline, a photo is
provided</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>These steps can reduce suicide incidence:</p>
<ul>
<li>Telling the audience where to find help, providing background information
about suicidal behavior, and what to do with people with suicidal thoughts.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Caltrain social media team should be praised for speaking about
passenger strikes and trespassers in generalities - never providing details
and only providing photos/video in incidents that did not lead to injury.</p>
<p>There are only a few reporters and outlets that cover Caltrain regularly so
working with them may pay dividends if we are not already doing it.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Somewhat Effective:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Reducing access to the railway more broadly:</em> This can come in many forms
besides platform doors - grade separations, more fencing, ticketed station
areas, identifying hot spots like mental hospitals and increasing
fencing there.</p>
<p>Several places on the Peninsula are considering grade separation projects
— Palo Alto, Burlingame, others — and reducing pedestrian access
to tracks should be a key consideration above and beyond grade separating
cars and trains.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><em>&quot;Suicide pits&quot; (deep channels between rails):</em> Some stations in the London
Underground have a pit three feet deep between the rails at stations. This
allows people who have second thoughts to duck below the train, and reduce the
potential for the train to drag people along with it, and thus cause further
injury. Strikes at Underground stations with pits are less likely to lead to
fatalities than stations without them.</p>
<p>This may be worthwhile to install at new stations such as the Hillsdale
station (if it is not already being considered).</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Needs More Study:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><em>Train design:</em> Fatal pedestrian/car accidents have been on the rise due to
<a href="https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/news/suv-craze-rising-pedestrian-deaths-report/">Americans buying larger cars with a higher front profile</a>. Similarly, the
design of the train engine may make strikes more or less deadly depending on the
design. A lower point of impact and a skirt which makes it impossible for a body
to go underneath the train may reduce the likelihood of a fatal injury.</p>
<p>An airbag that was deployed concurrently with the emergency brake could also
reduce the impact of a collision. There is not enough research into the
effect of these changes, though they may be cheap to implement relative to
grade separations or screen doors.</p>
<p>Given the lack of research here, perhaps a rail safety study sponsor could
fund a modified skirt design on half of the new engines that Caltrain is
ordering. We could then measure the injury and fatality rate of train
strikes with the modified skirt and the original design.</p>
</li>
</ul>
<p>Ineffective:</p>
<ul>
<li><em>Blue lights:</em> A study in Japan got attention for saying that blue LED lights
at station platforms led to a lower number of suicide attempts. A later study
found that the effect of blue lights was not measurable.</li>
</ul></div>

Introduction Often called stream processing, real-time processing allows applications to run computations and filter data at any scale. At Wallaroo Labs, we build and offer support for an event-based stream processing framework called Wallaroo. Frameworks like Wallaroo, allow you to do highly parallel computation across clusters of workers without having to worry about any additional complexity.
One of the things we hear from developers who aren’t familiar with stream processing is that they aren’t sure about the use cases.</div>

<p><em>Mao et. al., EuroSys 2012</em>
[<a href="https://pdos.csail.mit.edu/papers/masstree:eurosys12.pdf">paper</a>, <a href="https://github.com/kohler/masstree-beta">code</a>]</p>

<h5 id="the-big-idea">The Big Idea</h5>

<p>Consider the problem of storing, in memory, millions of <code>(key, value)</code> pairs, where <code>key</code> is a
variable-length string. If we just wanted to support point lookup, we&rsquo;d use a hash table. But
assuming we want to support range queries, some kind of tree structure is probably required. One
candidate might be a traditional B+-tree.</p>

<p>In such a B+-tree, the number of levels of the tree are kept small thanks to the fact that
each node has a high fan-out. However, that means that a large number of keys are packed into a
single node, and so there&rsquo;s still a large number of key comparisons to perform when searching
through the tree.</p>

<p>This is further exacerbated by variable-length keys (e.g. strings), where the cost of key
comparisons can be quite high. If the keys are really long they can each occupy multiple cache
lines, and so comparing two of them can really mess up your cache locality.</p>

<p>This paper proposes an efficient tree data structure that relies on splitting variable length keys
into a variable number of fixed-length keys called <em>slices</em>. As you go down the tree, you compare
the first slice of each key, then the second, then the third and so on, but each comparision has
<em>constant cost</em>.</p>

<p>For example, think about the string <code>the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog</code>. This string
consists of the following 8-byte slices: <code>the quic</code>, <code>k brown_</code>, <code>fox jump</code>, <code>s over t</code>, <code>he lazy_</code>
and finally <code>dog</code>. To find a string in a tree, you can look for all strings that match the first
slice first, and then look for the second slice only in strings that matched the first slice, and so
on - only comparing a <em>fixed</em> size subset of the key at any time. This is much more efficient than
comparing long strings to one another over and over again. The trick is to design a structure that
takes advantage of the cache benefits of doing these fixed-size comparisons, without losing a
tradeoff based on the large cardinality of the slice &lsquo;alphabet&rsquo;. Enter the <strong><em>Masstree</em></strong>.</p>

<span class="date">September 10, 2018 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>As I mentioned <a href="https://twitter.com/petecorey/status/1034631777795493888">on Twitter</a>, I’ve been experimenting lately with using a visually minimal <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a> setup. I’ve been using this new setup every day for several weeks, and I’m absolutely in love with it.</p>

<p>Want screenshots and an overview of how it works? Read on!</p>

<h2 id="but-first-screenshots">But First, Screenshots</h2>

<p><a href="https://github.com/rnkn/olivetti">Olivetti is an Emacs package</a> designed to create a distraction-free writing experience within your editor. Most of Olivetti’s screenshots show it in the context of editing markdown. That makes sense, as the term “distraction-free writing” is usually applied to the context of writing prose.</p>

<p>But what if I want a “distraction-free writing” environment for writing code?</p>

<p>It turns out that Olivetti is still perfectly suited for the job. Check out a few screenshots of my current Spacemacs setup. Note that the screenshots below capture <em>my entire screen</em>, from edge to edge. There’s nothing behind the curtain here:</p>

  <p>Spacemacs with Olivetti.</p>
</div>

<p>I’ve configured Olivetti to only activate when in <code class="language-lisp">prog-mode</code>, or in <code class="language-lisp">text-mode</code>. This means that things like Spacemac’s home buffer, and inline terminals retain their original layouts. This distinction has been working beautifully for me so far:</p>

  <p>Spacemacs with multiterm.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="using-olivetti-within-spacemacs">Using Olivetti within Spacemacs</h2>

<p>To get Olivetti working with Spacemacs, I needed an Olivetti <a href="https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs/blob/master/doc/LAYERS.org">layer</a>. Unfortunately, an out-of-the-box Spacemacs layer doesn’t exist for Olivetti. Thankfully, the process of creating a custom, private layer isn’t a difficult one.</p>

<p>We can create a new private layer from within Spacemacs by running the <code class="language-lisp">configuration-layer/create-layer</code> command with <code class="language-lisp">M-x</code> (or <code class="language-lisp">SPC</code> + <code class="language-lisp">:</code>). Let’s call our layer <code class="language-lisp">olivetti</code>. This creates a new <code class="language-lisp">~/.emacs.d/private/olivetti</code> folder and populates a <code class="language-lisp">packages.el</code> file with some boilerplate.</p>

<p>We’ll replace the contents of <code class="language-lisp">packages.el</code> with the following:</p>

<pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp">
(defconst olivetti-packages
  '(olivetti))

(defun olivetti/init-olivetti ()
  (use-package olivetti))
</code></pre>

<p>This tells Spacemacs that we need the <code class="language-lisp">olivetti</code> package, and to use the package once it’s been loaded.</p>

<p>Once that’s done, we need to edit our Spacemacs configuration file (<code class="language-lisp">SPC f e d</code>), and add an <code class="language-lisp">olivetti</code> entry under our <code class="language-lisp">dotspacemacs-configuration-layers</code> list to instruct Spacemacs to load our new private layer.</p>

<pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp">
(defun dotspacemacs/layers ()
  (setq-default
   ...
   dotspacemacs-configuration-layers
   '(
     ...
     olivetti
     )))
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we need to configure Olivetti to run in <code class="language-lisp">prog-mode</code> and <code class="language-lisp">text-mode</code>. We can do this in our <code class="language-lisp">dotspacemacs/user-config</code> callback:</p>

<pre class="language-lisp"><code class="language-lisp">
(add-hook 'text-mode-hook (lambda ()
                            (interactive)
                            (message "Olivetti text-mode-hook")
                            (olivetti-set-width 81)
                            (hidden-mode-line-mode)
                            (spacemacs/toggle-vi-tilde-fringe-off)
                            (olivetti-mode 1)))
(add-hook 'prog-mode-hook (lambda ()
                            (interactive)
                            (message "Olivetti prog-mode-hook")
                            (olivetti-set-width 81)
                            (hidden-mode-line-mode)
                            (spacemacs/toggle-vi-tilde-fringe-off)
                            (olivetti-mode 1)))
</code></pre>

<p>I use this opportunity to tune Olivetti and Spacemacs to my liking. Feel free to make any changes you deem necessary.</p>

<p>With that, we’re good to go!</p>

<h2 id="how-to-not-get-lost">How To Not Get Lost</h2>

<p>The key to not getting lost without any visual indicators is to always know where you are!</p>

<p>That may sound like a truism, but visually paring down my code editing environment has made me realize that there is no substitute for deep understanding and mastery of your tools. I don’t need a modeline to tell me which mode I’m in if I already know. I don’t need a constant reminder of which line I’m on, when I can navigate directly to any given line with <code class="language-lisp">:</code>.</p>

<p>Many of the visual indicators that modern editors provide are really just noise. I’m not going to say that noise is never helpful, but you can almost always get by without it.</p>

<p>If you’re interested in seeing <em>exactly</em> how my Spacemacs is set up, <a href="https://gist.github.com/pcorey/6b8d67d42a90c1c69913f58d211a576f">you can see my entire <code class="language-path">.spacemacs</code> file here</a>. It’s very ugly. I’m warning you now.</p></div>

But what if we want to make our app look nice?</p><p>Tell you what — why don’t we make our counter appear green when it’s over 1, red when it’s below 0 and grey when it’s 0. The logic should look like this;</p><ul><li>sum &gt; 0 = green</li><li>sum &lt; 0 = red</li><li>sum === 0 = green</li></ul><p>How would you do this?</p><p>We start with the Counter.vue component.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*G5lPlnWtClqWVVvoRTgbpg.png" />preparing the styles for the sum<p>I prepared 3 classes — .red, .green and .grey — each corresponding to their appropriate color.</p><p>Notice I’m passing the grey class to our sum span.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/752/1*AXp9QdOkLxfIVazCC8MaBw.png" />Our sum is grey colored<p>Well, it works — it’s grey like we told the sum to be. But it’s not turning green when it’s over 0 and it’s not turning red when it’s below 0.</p><p>We need to hook it up with Vue bindings!</p><p>Can you figure out how to do it? Remember our v-bind or the shorthand; this lets us write logic inside HTML.</p><h4>Ready? Here’s the solution;</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*uAT-WkGTTJbmQDIqxnl8cQ.png" /><p>Pay close attention to the class — it’s no regular class, it’s a Vue binding — which means we can insert logic and conditionals.</p><p>:class=”{‘grey’: sum === 0, ‘red’: sum &lt; 0, ‘green’: sum &gt; 0}”</p><p>Applying conditionals for styles is straightforward. Left side is the class name and on the right side is when that class is applied/conditional.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/832/1*85ldIdkfHi0xwHqKi_HEOA.gif" />Applying classes when conditions are met<p>Cool! There’s just one thing bothering me — the inline logic looks bad if there’s more than 1 conditional.</p><p>Let’s refactor the class conditionals to a method — more specifically to a <strong>computed property</strong>.</p><h3>Computed properties</h3><p>Putting too much logic in your templates can make them bloated and hard to maintain. That’s why for any complex logic, you should use a computed property.</p><p>Computed properties are cached based on their dependencies. A computed property will only re-evaluate when some of its dependencies have changed.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NwiBAOrz3gVcQBrgJ47YBA.png" />Creating our first computed property<p>There we go! We have our first computed property — much easier to read and we get more performance since computed properties are cached and only compute when they need to — when the conditionals are met in this case.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/960/1*E6sU7Buj5K68hzJ2cXKQBA.gif" />Notice the new “computed” property<p>Great job, we have covered most basic building blocks for Vue by now! See how intuitive Vue is? I love how there’s literally no plumbing involved.</p><h3>Parent-child communication</h3><p>When we’re building single page applications, we often have components which communicate with each other. The most common pattern we come across is the parent-children relationship.</p><p>Here’s an example parent to children component hierarchy;</p><pre>&lt;parent&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;children&gt;&lt;/children&gt;</pre><pre>&lt;/parent&gt;</pre><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/790/1*J1hOlYReJiKG0lxH1E4JeQ.png" /><p>We <strong>pass props from parent to children</strong> and <strong>emit events from child to parent</strong>.</p><h3>Slots</h3><p>Every modern app has so-called “container” components. In a nutshell, container components handle the logic and “components” handle the views (markup).</p><p>Here’s an in-depth explanation of the concept; it applies to all modern frontend frameworks.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0">Presentational and Container Components</a></p><p>Let’s refactor our counter by moving the counter to a separate and reusable component.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/708/1*Jr5bIPKKBZeigVYVmOvv7w.png" />Introducing slots<p>As you noticed by now, there’s a new element in our template. It’s called &lt;slot&gt;&lt;/slot&gt;</p><p>When the component renders, the &lt;slot&gt; element will be replaced by the content passed to it.</p><p>Import the Header.vue to our Counter.vue like so;</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/804/1*SO-BZMXLacSRb9qN7wK6Qw.png" />Importing the header component<p>Now we have access to the &lt;Header&gt;&lt;/Header&gt; component which renders the title passed to it.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/942/1*u8uz_MU_JCBFMnwbscV9Yg.png" />Passing the sum down the header component<p>If we check the browser you might notice something interesting.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/830/1*NjGj6fGc0WyxTJWGM8-c6A.gif" /><p>Everything changes color! What if we only want the number to change based on the sum.</p><h4>Named slots for the rescue!</h4><p>Named slots are a way we can control which content goes where.</p><p>We can give a name to our slot element like so;</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/680/1*pnniDcv6EdYMStrsD_i6Fg.png" />named slots; notice the “<strong>name”</strong> attribute on the slot<p>Parent renders regular HTML elements with a special attribute;</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/816/1*riFvTLuV8N4AAfowUov-4g.png" />Named slots notice we pass the class to the <strong>sum</strong> only<p>Tada! That’s all there is to slots!</p><p>Remember; The &lt;slot&gt; element is a placeholder for future content. A named slot is when we have more than 1 slot per component. The whole concept behind slots is to make code reusable as much as possible.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/880/1*tmSQ2cOao-fy4XPrEOqCLw.gif" />Result<p>There we go!</p><p>Here’s the source code;</p><p><a href="https://github.com/wesharehoodies/zero-to-hero-with-vue/tree/styling-props-slots">wesharehoodies/zero-to-hero-with-vue</a></p><p>Thanks for reading, see you at the next chapter where we will build something more complex and “real world” like. 👍</p><p>Here’s my <a href="https://twitter.com/lasnindrek">twitter</a>, you might find more useful stuff there!</p><ul><li><a href="https://twitter.com/lasnindrek">Indrek Lasn (@lasnindrek) | Twitter</a></li><li><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/the-secret-to-being-a-top-developer-is-building-things-heres-a-list-of-fun-apps-to-build-aac61ac0736c">The secret to being a top developer is building things!

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In the last installment of <a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2018/07/01/cleaning-up-part-two/">cleaning up</a>, I described how removing some infrequently used features from the site resulted in an even smaller size, especially when combined with minification. I have not stopped working on making this site nicer since. There have been a few things that annoyed me long enough that I sat down a few days ago, and fixed them. Turns out doing so was much easier than I thought.</p><p>The first thing I did was I redesigned the <a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/">landing page</a>: it used to show an excerpt from the latest blog post, a left over from ages past where I had more than one post shown there. This has been annoying me for a while, because such truncated posts are just plain horrible. On the other hand, I didn't want to put the whole most recent post on the landing page, either. What then should go there?</p><p>Because there are other things on this site than a blog (or, truth be told, used to be - the blog is the only useful thing here nowadays), I turned the landing page into a logo and a few buttons that lead to interesting places. This made the initial experience much better in my opinion: no more truncated post, handy links to various places - what's not to like?!</p><p>This, however, presented a problem: I needed to make the <a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/">blog archives</a> more useful. Previously, the archive was nothing more than a flat list of posts, without dates or anything. One could infer the date from the URL, but that's not a great experience, is it? So I added dates to the archives. But it was still a flat list, which is okay, but it could be better. For this reason, I grouped it by year, and indented the entries a little.</p><p>While there, I also removed a few places that injected bootstrap artifacts into the HTML, even though I don't use Bootstrap anymore. That saves me a few bytes each page, too.</p><p>With the improved archives and the landing page, I think the site design is at a place now that I'll be happy with for a while.</p></div>

<div class="content">
<p>I have used plenty of Emacs themes in the past, but in the end - like many others - I ended up creating my own. What I have now is <em>very</em> different than what I used even a year ago, let alone even before. It differs not just in colors, tone, or being light or dark - it differs fundamentally, in its goals. This theme is not for everybody, and I'm not going to try and convince You, my dear reader, that it is good for anyone but me. What I want to do today is explore the path I took, and how I ended up writing my own <a href="https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/brutalist-theme.el#repo-readme">brutalist-theme</a>.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-brutalist.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-brutalist.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + brutalist-theme" /></a></p><p>I will not be exploring the themes I used before switching to <a href="http://spacemacs.org/">Spacemacs</a>, because not only would I have to dig up my old Emacs configuration for that, it would also take a very, very long time. Eigtheen years of Emacs use has seen some themes, restricting myself to the last three years is plenty enough.</p><p>When I switched to Spacemacs, I initially used the <a href="https://github.com/cpaulik/emacs-material-theme/tree/master"><code>Material</code></a> theme, a dark theme with plenty of colors, mostly borrowed from Google's Material Design guidelines.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-material.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-material.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + material-theme" /></a></p><p>I used this theme for a bit over half a year, when I switched to <a href="https://github.com/sjrmanning/darkokai/tree/master"><code>darkokai</code></a>, still a dark theme, with somewhat stronger colors.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-darkokai.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-darkokai.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + darkokai-theme" /></a></p><p>It did not last long, I switched to the <a href="https://github.com/emacs-mirror/emacs/blob/master/etc/themes/misterioso-theme.el"><code>misterioso</code></a> theme in just a month. While still a dark theme, it felt a bit lighter, less hard on the eyes.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-misterioso.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-misterioso.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + misterioso-theme" /></a></p><p>...this did not last long, I switched to <a href="https://github.com/bbatsov/solarized-emacs/tree/master"><code>solarized-dark</code></a> within a week. At that point, I was a big fan of the Solarized palette, and used it for my terminal too.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-solarized-dark.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-solarized-dark.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + solarized-dark-theme" /></a></p><p>It has been in use for about a year, when I switched to <a href="https://github.com/philiparvidsson/GitHub-Modern-Theme-For-Emacs/tree/master"><code>github-modern</code></a>, my first foray into light themes. I have looked at light themes before, but none of them really stuck, some of the colors were always unreadable, or looked just plain wrong. But <code>github-modern</code> was something I liked, possibly because when I wasn't spending time in Emacs, I was mostly looking at GitHub, so the colors were familiar. Around this time, I started to use two monitors, with Emacs on the primary one, a browser (usually with GitHub shown) on the other. The contrast of the dark editor and the light browser were annoying - which is why I went looking for a light theme in the first place.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-github-modern.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-github-modern.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + github-modern-theme" /></a></p><p>This is where things start to get interesting. This was in 2017, I already had an ergonomic keyboard, and was in the process of transforming my environment to feel better, to really serve me. I started to make conscious decisions about things I largely ignored before. One of my goals at this time was to reduce distractions. For many years, I've been using full-screen windows, to be able to focus on one thing only at a time. I still had a number of applications that popped up notifications for me, but by 2017, I disabled those notifications, and banished these applications to a second screen. This way I didn't get interrupted, I didn't need to switch my focused application, but could still look at these things whenever I wanted to. I found that looking at the second screen was much less effort, and a lot less distracting than either notifications or switching applications on my main screen.</p><p>There was, however, one notable exception where I did not make an effort to reduce distraction: my editor. I've read a number of articles about syntax highlighting (or rather, the lack of thereof), such as "<a href="http://www.linusakesson.net/programming/syntaxhighlighting/">A case against syntax highlighting</a>". I've had colleagues who did not use syntax highlighting at all, too. It was an intriguing concept, I tried it myself too a few times, but always came back to my colors.</p><p>This all changed this may, when I started experimenting with the <a href="https://github.com/maio/eink-emacs/tree/master"><code>eink
theme</code></a>. It was an eye opener: I could use syntax highlighting, but without the distraction!</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-eink.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-eink.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + eink-theme" /></a></p><p>You see, unlike Linus Åkesson (the author of the article above) or <a href="https://groups.google.com/d/msg/golang-nuts/hJHCAaiL0so/WLKD3zcVvfoJ">Rob Pike</a>, I like some <em>gentle</em> syntax highlighting, much like <a href="https://www.robertmelton.com/posts/syntax-highlighting-off/">Robert Melton</a> among other people. I believe that highlighting matching parentheses, the current line, or the selected region, or search hits all add useful information. Additionally, there are parts of source code that I think deserve to be presented differently than normal text. Fortunately, there's a solution that often does not involve colors at all! There's weight, underlining, slant, inverse colors - they can all be used to apply some minimal, not too distracting visual aids.</p><p>I do not agree with turning syntax highlighting completely off being a useful thing one should do. Quite the contrary. Belittling visual aids is a mistake, akin to throwing away utensils because you can just eat with your hand. You can do that, but most people will not, because utensils are useful. Use simple tools that get the job done, and do no more, but do use tools that make your life better. You don't need fancy spoons with elaborate decoration, or even jewels embedded. But eating soup with a spoon is a lot easier than doing so without (unless you can drink it, of course, but not all soups are like that).</p><p>On the other hand, over the years I learned that distracting colors are a bother, something I do not really need. Therefore, a minimal theme that highlights things I want highlighted, in an unobtrusive manner, possibly with markup other than colors is something I strive for.</p><p>This is the aim of my <a href="https://git.madhouse-project.org/algernon/brutalist-theme.el#repo-readme"><code>brutalist theme</code></a>: not the banishment of color, because it still uses colors for some select things (such as search results, links, strings, selection, and a number of others); not a banishment of syntax highlighting, because I believe it is useful; not a strive for minimalism either. It is none of those things. It may have a thing or two common with those goals, but that is purely coincidence.</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-brutalist.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-brutalist.thumb.png" alt="Emacs + brutalist-theme" /></a></p><p>The goal of my theme is to be as free of distraction as possible, while still providing hints where I feel they are necessary. It is supposed to expose the underlying context, to guide me to the content, but stay out of my way otherwise. It is brutally pragmatic, and in many ways, focuses on raw content true to its construction. I try to remove color as much as possible, and prefer other forms of distinction instead. Sometimes I do have to fall back to using colors, and that is okay. It is done with care, and plenty of experimenting before committing to a particular face.</p><p>I do not want to get rid of syntax highlighting, nor do I preach minimalism. The theme is merely a pragmatic one that happens to borrow ideas from a lot of places - but that's only that. It does not strive for either, nor imitate. It borrows, as long as that serves the purpose of not being needlessly distracting.</p><p>Combined with <a href="https://github.com/joostkremers/writeroom-mode/tree/master"><code>writeroom-mode</code></a>, we get a solid, distraction-free environment. Mind you, to be truly productive with this setup, one needs to be familiar with their editor, because it provides only the essential hints. But that's the beauty of it: once you know each other well, there is little reason for the fancy facade.</p><p>In closing, the evolution of my Emacs themes looks somewhat like this:</p><p><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-theme-montage.png"><img src="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/assets/asylum/images/posts/the-brutalist-path/emacs-theme-montage.thumb.png" alt="Emacs theme montage" /></a></p><p>All of these pictures were taken with my current Emacs setup. At the time of using each theme, my setup was different: I had a modeline, or line numbers, and so on. In this respect, the images lack a bit of context. But the evolution is interesting nevertheless.</p></div>

<p>Most software <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2017/12/27/almost-all-published-analysis-of-fault-data-is-worthless/">fault prediction papers are based on a false assumption</a>, i.e., a list of dates when a fault was first experienced, by a program, contains enough information to build a model that has a connection to reality.  A <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2018/03/18/estimating-the-number-of-distinct-faults-in-a-program/">count of faults that have been experienced twice</a> is also required, to fit a basic model that has some mathematical connection to reality.</p>

<p><a href="https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article/figure?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0181524.t001">Table 1 lists</a> the every increasing number of cycles within cycles; the new model is proposed as the 12th refinement (the table is a summary, lots of forks have been proposed over the years).  I have this sinking feeling there is another paper in the works, one that &#8216;benchmarks&#8217; the new equation using a collection of the other regular <del datetime="2018-09-06T01:08:16+00:00">characters</del> data sets that appear in papers of this kind.</p>
<p>Fitting an equation to data of first experience of a fault is little better than fitting noise.</p>

<h4><a href="http://gerikson.com/blog/books/read/Examples.html"><em>Examples: The Making of 40 Photographs</em> by Ansel Adams</a>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content" lang="en">
<p>I enjoyed this book immensely. Adam&#8217;s photographs are so well-known as to be worn smooth of all meaning, elevated to vacuous &#8220;fine art&#8221;, but reading Adam&#8217;s descriptions of how they were made, what he was thinking, what eventual mistakes he made <em>et cetera</em> humanizes them and brings them down to a plane where we mere mortals can begin to think: &#8220;I could make that&#8221;.</p>

<p>This is of course why Adams is known all over the English-speaking (well, American) world as &#8220;the greatest photographer ever&#8221;. His career as a teacher, coupled with a subject matter dear to the ideal idea of America, as well as his undeniable rigor as a developer of technique, has ensured that.</p>

<p>But sometimes, reading these stories, you glimpse nostalgia for a youthful life of clambering around Yosemite with glass-plate negatives in his rucksack, and the entire future of celebrity, hard work, and backbreaking labor in the darkroom in blissful unawareness. </p></div>

<span class="date">September 03, 2018 12:00 AM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A common trend I see in Elixir projects is that modules tend to become large. <a href="https://github.com/elixir-ecto/ecto/blob/master/lib/ecto/query.ex">Sometimes <em>very large</em></a>. This isn’t necessarily an issue, but it goes against some deep seated heuristics I have for building software.</p>

<p>As <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord/">my <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> project</a> started to get complex, I repeatedly found myself reaching for a pattern to keep my module size and complexity down, while still maintaining a friendly and approachable API.</p>

<p>Let’s dig into some examples.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem?</h2>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module is the heart of <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord/">my <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> project</a>. Using <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> you can generate guitar chord voicings, generate possible fingerings for a given voicing, and even calculate the distances between various chord voicings and fingerings.</p>

<p>It’s conceivable that lots of this functionality should live directly under the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module. For example, we’d want to be able to ask for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>,  or <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>, or even convert a chord into a chord chart with <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>.</p>

<p>The problem is that each of these pieces of functionality comes along with a non-trivial implementation. If we put our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> functions in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module, their implementations would likely live in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module as well. In my mind, this would quickly turn <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> into an unmaintainable mess.</p>

<p>There has to be a better way.</p>

<h2 id="whats-the-solution">What’s the solution?</h2>

<p>It turns out there is a better way. And, like most better ways, it turns out that the solution to our problem is obviously simple.</p>

<p>Let’s use our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function as an example. Rather than defining our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function and implementation within our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module, we’ll create a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Voicing</span></code> module and <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord/blob/55ec2d6069366e0d78a6cf4a9bde59c589171c08/lib/chord/voicing.ex#L2-L9">define our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function there</a>.</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Voicing do
  def voicings(notes, notes_in_chord \\ nil),
    do: ...
end
</code></pre>

<p>Now our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Voicing</span></code> module is entirely concerned with the act of generating chord voicings for a given set of notes.</p>

<div class="post-footer">
    <div class="signup-form">
        <form action="http://east5th.us11.list-manage.com/subscribe/post?u=f8833fd40e2b1b28545d9f382&id=c56ceba687" method="post" id="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" name="mc-embedded-subscribe-form" target="_blank">

                                                                                                                                                                                                    --><input type="submit" value="Subscribe" name="subscribe" id="mc-embedded-subscribe" />

        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>However, we still want this functionality available through our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module. To accomplish this, we simply need to write a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function that matches the signature of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Voicing</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> module and passes the call straight through to <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord/blob/55ec2d6069366e0d78a6cf4a9bde59c589171c08/lib/chord.ex">our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Voicing</span></code> module</a>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord do
  def voicings(notes, notes_in_chord \\ nil),
    do: Chord.Voicing.voicings(notes, notes_in_chord)
end
</code></pre>

<p>We can continue on with this pattern by creating a new module to implement each of our features: <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Fingering</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span></code>. From there we can flesh our our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module to wire our convenience functions up to their actual implementations:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord do
  def voicings(notes, notes_in_chord \\ nil),
    do: Chord.Voicing.voicings(notes, notes_in_chord)

  def to_string(chord, chord_name \\ nil),
    do: Chord.Renderer.to_string(chord, chord_name)

  def fingerings(chord),
    do: Chord.Fingering.fingerings(chord)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Beautiful.</p>

<h2 id="enter-delegates">Enter Delegates</h2>

<p>Using the above pattern, we might make a mistake when passing the arguments from our first function head into the function in our implementation module (I’ve done it before).</p>

<p>Thankfully, Elixir gives us a way to prevent this mistake:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord do
  defdelegate voicings(notes, notes_in_chord \\ nil), to: Chord.Voicing
  defdelegate to_string(chord, chord_name \\ nil), to: Chord.Renderer
  defdelegate fingerings(chord), to: Chord.Fingering
end
</code></pre>

<p>Using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/Kernel.html#defdelegate/2">the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="k">defdelegate</span></code> macro</a>, we can define the interface for each of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> functions in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module, and point each of these function heads to their implementation module.</p>

<p>Elixir automatically wires each of the delegated functions together, preventing any mindless developer mistakes from creeping into our codebase.</p>

<h2 id="whats-in-a-name">What’s in a name?</h2>

<p>In the previous example, the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module is essentially acting as a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Facade_pattern">“facade”</a> that wraps and hides the complexity of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Voicing</span></code>, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Fingering</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span></code> modules.</p>

<p>I use the term “facade” loosely, and in real-life, I don’t use it at all. The “facade pattern”, and honestly all classic <a href="https://amzn.to/2BVHHIo">Gang of Four design patterns</a>, carry  baggage that I like to think I’ve let go of in my transition into the world of functional programming.</p>

<p>Another less weighty way to think of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> is as an “API module”. It’s sole purpose is to act as an “application programming interface” within our application.</p>

<p>What would you call this kind of pattern?</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://kev.inburke.com/kevin/ssf-bike-ped-improvements-east-of-101/">Bike and pedestrian improvements east of the South San Francisco Caltrain station</a>

<span class="date">September 02, 2018 03:21 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>For the past month or so I've been commuting to a biotech office east of 101 in
South San Francisco. I've gotten a little depressed about how car-centric the
infrastructure is and I wanted to share some small wins that could improve the
bike and pedestrian experience.</p>
<p>Why bother? Well, the roads get really full at commute time and it's not easy to
expand them. People biking and walking (5 sq ft and 2 sq ft) take up less space
than they do in a car (150 sq ft), so you can fit more people on the roads.
They're also faster - I routinely get to Caltrain faster on a bike than I would
be able to in a car, because the bike lane is empty.</p>
<p>However, the experience is currently not great, which means it's scary for a lot
of folks to bike. Here are some small things that South San Francisco could do
to make it easier for pedestrians.</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p><strong>Put WALK signs in front of the limit line:</strong> This WALK sign at Forbes and
East Grand is behind the limit line.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/walk-behind-limit-line.jpg" />
<p>If a bus or truck is in the first spot - which is common, Genentech runs
shuttles quite frequently - you can't see the sign or figure out when the
WALK sign is on. Moving the WALK sign in front of the limit line would
increase visibility, and also...</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Put pedestrian crossing buttons closer together.</strong> It's at least 20 feet
between these WALK buttons at East Grand and Gateway.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/distance-between-crosswalks.jpg" />
<p>If you are trying to cross the street diagonally - which will become more
common when the Caltrain station moves - you have to walk a long way to
press both buttons. Better would be to put the buttons on the same pole.
This would also move the WALK sign ahead of the limit line.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/both-directions-button-cropped.png" />
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Prioritize pedestrian traffic.</strong> Often you have to wait a long time to cross
the street after pressing the button. The crossing could stop the flow of cars
soon after a pedestrian signals their intention to cross the street, or stop
more often in the minutes before a Caltrain is scheduled to depart from the
station. If we want to encourage pedestrian traffic we should not make walkers
wait as long at intersections.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Narrow car lanes and make better bike lanes.</strong> If you want to encourage
cycling you want to have networks, where people can bike places and feel safe
the whole way. There are some bike lanes east of 101, but they don't form
a network, or allow you to go where you are trying to go.</p>
<p>The bike lane starts at the bottom of the bridge over the train tracks. The
outside lane of East Grand at this point is 21 feet wide. This is enough
room for a 2 foot gutter, 4 foot bike lane, 2 feet of protection, and a 13
foot car lane. Adding a bike lane in this stretch would make bicyclists feel
safer.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/east-grand-bike-lane-room.jpg" />
<p>Between Gateway and Roebling St. the outside lane of East Grand is 16 feet
and the inside lane is about 13 feet. Making each of those 11 feet would
give enough room for the gutter and a 4 foot bike lane. 11 feet might feel
cozy for a &quot;main arterial&quot; but again - cars aren't going that fast on this
road anyway due to the high number of stoplights and other cars on that
road.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/east-grand-bike-lane-roebling.jpg" />
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Integrated plan for getting walkers/bikers from the new Caltrain
undercrossing to Verily/Genentech/Pfizer etc:</strong> There are plans for a new
station platform and a undercrossing which comes out near the Poletti Way
offramp, but after that there are lots of unresolved questions. The SSF
&quot;Downtown Station Area Specific Plan&quot; merely says &quot;design will need to consider
safe access&quot; without specifying what the design <em>will</em> end up being.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/poletti-design.png" />
<p>If I am biking from downtown South San Francisco to Verily, Pfizer or
Genentech, should I take the undercrossing - is the undercrossing wide
enough for both cyclists and pedestrians? - or is the Grand Ave bridge still
the recommended way to go?</p>
<p>What is the plan for getting pedestrians and cyclists across the Poletti Way
offramp and to the biotech campuses? Some ideas:</p>
<ul>
<li>
<p>Extend the tunnel under the Poletti Way offramp. Otherwise, add a speed
table and a wide curb bulbout to make it easier and safer for pedestrians to
cross Poletti Way. Here's an example of what this could look like:</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/speed-table-crosswalk.png" />
<p>A scramble intersection could also work there.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Extend the bike lane on Gateway north of East Grand, a bike lane that's
in the Bicycle Master Plan. Does the city own the land east and west of the
roadway? This could be used to add bike lanes without making changes to the
roadway.</p>
</li>
<li>
<p>Remove the eastbound parking lane on East Grand near the Caltrain
undercrossing, then add a bike lane + pedestrian path next to the tree line,
straight across East Grand to Gateway.</p>
</li>
</ul>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/bike-ped-lane.png" />
</li>
<li>
<p><strong>Remove setback requirements:</strong> Most of the offices and stores are set back
from the street across acres of parking.</p>
  <img src="https://kev.inburke.com/rawblog/images/ssf-ped/surrounded-by-parking.png" />
<p>These are unfriendly to pedestrians, since you have to walk further to
get where you are going. Allowing stores and offices to be built right up
against the property line will reduce walking times, allow pedestrians
to stop to shop on their way to and from work, and encourage walking and
cycling.</p>
</li>
</ul>

You see — Vue is somewhat unique. Vue has its own .vue files which contain the html, javascript and styles. It’s truly fun to work with! For the .vue files we need a module bundler.</p><p>The module bundler of my choice will be <a href="https://parceljs.org/">Parcel</a> since it’s really easy to setup. I’m using Parcel since the purpose of this series is to learn Vue. 😃</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AXwoLu4u10rTe5-VgkP31Q.png" />Everything You Need To Know About Parcel: The Blazing Fast Web App Bundler 🚀<a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-parcel-dbe151b70082">https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-parcel-dbe151b70082</a><p><a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-parcel-dbe151b70082">Everything You Need To Know About Parcel: The Blazing Fast Web App Bundler 🚀</a></p><p>Bring up your terminal and initialize a Node project, like so:</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1000/1*yTnkcgOjnpV2ICaN3eV64Q.png" /><pre>npm init -y</pre><p>Now we have a package.json and can start using NPM modules.

There are many advantages having a server instead editing local files — the most convincing features are: Vue Dev tools, hot reloading, .vue components, building and shipping the app to a production server. We’ll cover all of those features later on. Good job for making it this far! You’re getting the hang of it. 👍</p><h3>Refactoring to .Vue components</h3><p>Currently we have a single file which holds all the logic and markup. The modern approach to building single page apps is to split the app to manageable components.</p><p>It’s time we start thinking about how to structure our app. Common pattern is to create a src folder and place app specific logic there.</p><p>Let’s create the src folder and two .vue files. App.vue and Counter.vue</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/578/1*kbTfEbaKbgyBjYw9PV7GKw.png" />creating the src folder with two Vue components inside<p>Can you guess what each component does?

We’re far at the SPA land now, no turning back! Also new property called render — this renders our markup. It’s a function and we pass our App.vue component as the sole argument. Basically the render functions turns the App.vue into something the browser can understand.</p><p>Bring out the big guns, it’s time to reveal what a .vue file looks like.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/872/1*lNQHeyodNg7P84h1hlpZBA.png" />App.vue<p>Woah! Looks strange at first, doesn’t it? Well, it all makes sense actually.</p><p>.Vue components are neat — they include 3 different syntaxes. Yes — 3!</p><p>We can write valid HTML, Javascript and CSS inside our .vue files.</p><p>Each syntax is divided by the following section;</p><ul><li>&lt;template&gt;&lt;/template&gt; — HTML</li><li>&lt;script&gt;&lt;/script&gt; — Javascript</li><li>&lt;styles&gt;&lt;/styles&gt; — CSS</li></ul><p>The reason why we want to do this is simple — we can create encapsulated components with dedicated responsibilities. Think as SPAs human bodies — each organ has its responsibility and functionality — same goes for each .vue component.</p><p>Remember the template property where we declared our HTML? Well we have a dedicated section for that now.</p><p>Remember the methods and data properties? We have a dedicated space for them too now!</p><p>Here’s the Counter.vue component</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*OFnD6F3IigFoBCOf1UQGVg.png" />Counter.vue<p>Looks familiar?

<h4><a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2018/09/02/fonts-xcb.html">Xft but for XCB</a>

<span class="date">September 01, 2018 09:00 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In this post I’m going to go over “fonts for xcb” a mini-project I’ve
been working on recently and I’ll documents the parts that are not
usually found online.</p>

<p>XCB, the X C Binding, is a client library that offers a set of C functions
to interact with the X graphical server in a lightweight minimal way. You
can refer to this <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2016/10/25/x11-blah-blah.html">older post</a>
to understand more about what this library is about. XCB is getting
popular in the niche world of small graphical utilities and window manager
however it doesn’t offer everything. One thing in particular it doesn’t
offer is a facility for pretty font handling.</p>

<p>There are many reasons for this, first not many are interested in XCB
in itself, Xlib (The older easier synchronous X client side library)
is much easier to handle. Second of all, XCB is hardly documented and
thus has a big barrier of entry. Third of all, it’s missing wrapper
functions that were present in Xlib. And fourth of all, Wayland is on
its way (though long way) to make X deprecated.</p>

<p>That is why I’ve made the
<a href="https://github.com/venam/fonts-for-xcb">font-for-xcb</a> project, to
document my process and offer a base for others that are interested in
learning about fonts, rendering, and XCB.</p>

<p>Enough talk, let’s got through the process needed to implement good font
rendering with xcb.</p>

<p>You probably need to review what was discussed in this posts <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2017/06/04/fonts-on-unix.html">Fonts
on Unix</a> as its a direct
application of the knowledge from there.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The people that truly understand the full font stack can be counted
on one’s hand, I’d like to salute those true heroes.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>The steps can be divided into the following:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fontconfig for font selection and configuration</li>
  <li>Freetype for font rasterization</li>
  <li>Xrender for rendering</li>
  <li>Extra - Font fallback</li>
  <li>Wrappers for merging things together in an easy library</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="fontconfig-for-font-selection-and-configuration">Fontconfig for font selection and configuration</h3>

<p>To begin you have to select a font and how that font is going to be
displayed. The best way to do that is to rely on the fontconfig library,
which is probably already present on your machine. You know this is the
case when you issue the command <code class="highlighter-rouge">fc-match "some font name"</code>.</p>

<p>The reference for developers is found
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/">here</a>
however it isn’t explaining but rather simply laying down the function
names and data structures within the library.</p>

<p>The crux of the functionality lies within building a “search
pattern” and matching using this pattern. A “search pattern” is
composed of whatever font properties you are looking for, those are
not limited to font names but can be anything from font weight to
font family name, to what characters should be present in the font
character set. You can find the list of possible font properties
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/x19.html#AEN27">here</a>.</p>

<p>The possibilities with fontconfig are not limited to search but everything
related to fonts and fonts sets listing, getting the properties in the
font matched, manipulating the structures related to fonts like characters
in different encoding such as utf8, utf16, and Ucs4, and much more.</p>

<p>The easiest way to do the search is to match the font from a
string that will be interpreted automatically by fontconfig as all
the parameters that need to be found in the result of the search. If
you’ve ever used Xft this is the same search string in a form similar to:</p>

<p><code class="highlighter-rouge">&lt;families&gt;-&lt;point sizes&gt;:&lt;name1&gt;=&lt;values1&gt;:&lt;name2&gt;=&lt;values2&gt;...</code></p>

<p>This is documented in the user page for fontconfig
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-user.html#AEN36">here</a>.
To do that you have to convert the font query from a string to an actual
usable pattern.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    // initialize the fontconfig library
    FcInit();
    FcChar8 *fontquery = "times:pixelsize=20";
    FcPattern *fc_finding_pattern = FcNameParse(fontquery);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As you can see
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/fcnameparse.html">FcNameParse</a>
isn’t documented in the reference. <code class="highlighter-rouge">fc_finding_pattern</code> will contain the
pattern that we can use to do the matching later on. So the next step is
to use that pattern to match a font, however it’s a good idea, sometimes,
to let fontconfig fill some default configuration is has for things we
haven’t set yet in the search. We do that using <code class="highlighter-rouge">FcDefaultSubstitute</code>
and passing it the pattern. There’s also a substitution to fill system
configuration values set for the kind of pattern, a FcMatchPattern.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    FcBool status;
    FcDefaultSubstitute(fc_finding_pattern);
    status = FcConfigSubstitute(NULL, fc_finding_pattern, FcMatchPattern);
    if (status == FcFalse) {
        fprintf(stderr, "could not perform config font substitution");
    }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>So how do we know what it’s actually filling in the pattern? There’s a
function offered by fontconfig to do exactly that.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    FcPatternPrint(fc_finding_pattern);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The last step after creating the pattern is the actual matching.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    FcResult result;
    FcPattern *pat_output = FcFontMatch(NULL, fc_finding_pattern, &amp;result);

    FcPatternDestroy(fc_finding_pattern);
    if (result == FcResultMatch) {
        FcValue fc_file;
        FcPatternGet(pat_output, FC_FILE, 0, &amp;fc_file);
        printf("found the font in the file: %s\n", (const char *)fc_file.u.s);
    } else if (result == FcResultNoMatch) {
        fprintf(stderr, "there wasn't a match");
    } else {
        fprintf(stderr, "the match wasn't as good as it should be");
    }
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The result will also be stored in a pattern structure and whatever is not
needed anymore should be cleaned using fontconfig built-in functions such
as <code class="highlighter-rouge">FcPatternDestroy</code>. You may ask what is the difference if the result
is stored in a pattern but the search is also a pattern. What differs
is that the real values of the font properties will be filled and usable
now. Properties such as <code class="highlighter-rouge">file</code> which is “The filename holding the font”
for example.</p>

<p>Let’s be aware that some values returned or filled from a fontconfig
function may not need to be cleaned as they are pointers to other values
found inside living structures and not newly allocated values. For
instance, when issuing FcPatternGet for the <code class="highlighter-rouge">fc_file</code> in the example
above we don’t need to free the variable.</p>

<p>And so we’ve found our font, now how to load and use the glyphs in it?</p>

<h3 id="freetype-for-font-rasterization">Freetype for font rasterization</h3>

<p>We have a match and its properties, we should now load the font
content itself so that we can use the glyphs in it. That is what
we call rasterizing, converting from a mathematical definition
(here the font file) to actual bitmap/pixel representation. This
is done with the <a href="https://www.freetype.org/">Freetype</a> library. To
start with Freetype it’s good to read their <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/index.html">Glyph Conventions
page</a>. It
explains things such as the difference between a face and a font family,
what are the metrics used in fonts, kerning, and much more.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    // (1)
    FT_Library library;
    FT_Init_FreeType(&amp;library);

    // (2)
    FcValue fc_file, fc_index;
    result = FcPatternGet(pat_output, FC_FILE, 0, &amp;fc_file);
    if (result != FcResultMatch) {
        fprintf(stderr, "font has not file location");
    }
    result = FcPatternGet(pat_output, FC_INDEX, 0, &amp;fc_index);
    if (result != FcResultMatch) {
        fprintf(stderr, "font has no index, using 0 by default");
        fc_index.type = FcTypeInteger;
        fc_index.u.i = 0;
    }

    // (3)
    FT_Face face;
    FT_New_Face(
            library,
            (const char *) fc_file.u.s,
            fc_index.u.i,
            &amp;face);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Loading a face happens in 3 steps. (1) The freetype library needs to be
loaded if not already. (2) The value for the font file location and the
face index within that font file needs to be extracted from the fontconfig
pattern match of earlier. (3) Finally the loading of the face happens with
<code class="highlighter-rouge">FT_New_Face</code>.</p>

<p>Much more options can be set on the face later on after it has been
loaded. Glyph modifications such as slants for italic, pixel or point
size change, etc..</p>

<p>Let’s say we have some text we want to write, we have loaded a face,
and we want to get the glyph for every characters in that text. Every
glyph in a face has an index and we use that index to fetch the glyph.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    char *text = "hello world";

    int glyph_index = FT_Get_Char_Index(
        face,
        text[0]);
    if (glyph_index == 0) {
        fprintf(stderr, "The character 'h' doesn't have a glyph in this face");
    }

    FT_Select_Charmap(face, ft_encoding_unicode);
    FT_Load_Glyph(face, glyph_index, FT_LOAD_RENDER | FT_LOAD_FORCE_AUTOHINT);

    FT_Bitmap *bitmap = &amp;face-&gt;glyph-&gt;bitmap;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The <code class="highlighter-rouge">FT_Load_Glyph</code> function renders/rasterizes the glyph and
make the bitmap object of type <code class="highlighter-rouge">FT_Bitmap</code> point to it. In fact
<code class="highlighter-rouge">face-&gt;glyph-&gt;bitmap</code> will always point to the latest rasterized glyph.</p>

<p>We have the bits/pixels form of the character we want to display on the
screen but what if there are many of them, how would we know the space
to add between every characters. There are fonts that are horizontal,
others that are vertical, some with ligature, and other much fancier
features. Unfortunately this isn’t something that is provided by
Freetype, those last features are part of what we refer to as a font
shaping engine such as HarfBuzz. However, for simple cases like ours,
the distance between glyphs can be queried from the “advance”, which is a
glyph metric that you get when loading the font via Freetype representing
how much you need to move forward in x or y position.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>    FT_Vector glyph_advance;
    glyph_advance.x = face-&gt;glyph-&gt;advance.x/64;
    glyph_advance.y = face-&gt;glyph-&gt;advance.y/64;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The division by 64 is out of scope of this article,
it is related to typographic metrics. You can check <a href="https://www.freetype.org/freetype2/docs/glyphs/glyphs-3.html#section-3">this
page</a>
for more information.</p>

<h3 id="xrender-for-rendering">Xrender for rendering</h3>

<p>Alright, thus far we haven’t mentioned xcb at all but in this section
we will. We have loaded our glyph from its glyph index within the font
file into an <code class="highlighter-rouge">FT_Bitmap</code> structure, that means we have its representation
rasterized, its pixel form, now how do we get this unto the screen.</p>

<p>To do that we have to yet again tackle another topic
called “digital image composition” which is the base for
rendering within the X window system. The documenttion
on this one is also scarce, all theoretical. Those
two pages are the base of the concept: “<a href="https://www.x.org/releases/current/doc/renderproto/renderproto.txt">The X Rendering
Extension</a>”
and “<a href="https://keithp.com/~keithp/talks/usenix2001/xrender/">Design and Implementation of the X Rendering
Extension</a>”.
Rendering was also discussed in one of the previous
posts called <a href="https://venam.nixers.net/blog/unix/2018/05/10/reparenting-redirecting-composition-rendering.html">Drawables, Regions, Shapes, Types of
WM, Reparenting, Compositing, Redirecting, Unredirecting,
Rendering</a>.
It’s a good idea to review that last post to get a better general
knowledge of rendering.</p>

<p>Digital image composition, or what we call here “rendering” is about
taking the pixels we’ve got from somewhere (glyph) and mix them up with
other pixels from somewhere else (on a pixmap). There are
many rendering engines as was said in the previous post so we’ll limit
ourselves to discussing the XRender engine.</p>

<p>All rendering engine, Xrender included, offer basic pixel
operations that come from a paper by Porter and Duff in 1984
called the “Porter-Duff compositing model”, also known as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alpha_compositing">alpha
compositing</a>. The cool
and maybe intimidating name asides those operations are quite simple,
they are bitwise operation done on the two pixels given as input. Things
such as binary Xor and Add are certainly there, plus operations such as
Src or Dst which will only take one side of the inputs (the source or
the destination). There are plenty of others like reversing the pixels,
or merging them, or taking the minimum or the maximum values.</p>

<p>To use that rendering concept within XCB you can rely on the XRender
library or use an external one like OpenGL. Let’s limit ourselves
to XRender.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	#include &lt;xcb/render.h&gt;
	#include &lt;xcb/xcb_renderutil.h&gt;
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>The world of xcb introduces the concept of “picture” to join together
the rendering operation with the canvas/pixmap it’s drawing to.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	xcb_render_picture_t picture;
	// c being the xcb_connection_t
	picture = xcb_generate_id(c);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Like other things within the X windowing system, pictures are objects
with unique identifiers.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	// (1)
	uint32_t values[2];
	values[0] = XCB_RENDER_POLY_MODE_IMPRECISE;
	values[1] = XCB_RENDER_POLY_EDGE_SMOOTH;


	// (2)
	xcb_render_pictforminfo_t *fmt;
	const xcb_render_query_pict_formats_reply_t *fmt_rep =
	xcb_render_util_query_formats(c);

	fmt = xcb_render_util_find_standard_format(
		fmt_rep,
		XCB_PICT_STANDARD_RGB_24
	);


	// (3)
	cookie = xcb_render_create_picture_checked(c,
		picture, // pid
		pmap, // drawable
		fmt-&gt;id, // format
		XCB_RENDER_CP_POLY_MODE|XCB_RENDER_CP_POLY_EDGE,
		values); // make it smooth
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>To create a picture, attaching both rendering/composition to a drawable
such as a pixmap, you need at least two things: A mode of rendering
(how precise does the merging happens) and a picture format (the depth
and pixel format of the picture).</p>

<p>The picture could be used to do any composition operations and the
result will appear on the drawable. Specifically in our case to draw
glyphs xcb provides a helper data structure to hold a set of glyphs and
draw text that has characters within that glyph set, this is called the
<code class="highlighter-rouge">xcb_render_glyphset_t</code>.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	const xcb_render_query_pict_formats_reply_t *fmt_rep =
		xcb_render_util_query_formats(c);

	xcb_render_pictforminfo_t *fmt_a8 = xcb_render_util_find_standard_format(
		fmt_rep,
		XCB_PICT_STANDARD_A_8
	);

	xcb_render_glyphset_t gs = xcb_generate_id(c);
	xcb_render_create_glyph_set(c, gs, fmt_a8-&gt;id);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>As with the picture the glyphset being a composition object needs to have
a format. To add a glyph of the <code class="highlighter-rouge">FT_Bitmap</code> type to the glyphset we have
to fill an <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcb_render_glyphinfo_t</code>, which is a translation between the
glyph type inside FreeType and the ones within XCB.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	// the glyphinfo we want to convert from FreeType to XCB
	xcb_render_glyphinfo_t ginfo;

	// the basic information
	ginfo.x = -face-&gt;glyph-&gt;bitmap_left;
	ginfo.y = face-&gt;glyph-&gt;bitmap_top;
	ginfo.width = bitmap-&gt;width;
	ginfo.height = bitmap-&gt;rows;
	ginfo.x_off = glyph_advance.x;
	ginfo.y_off = glyph_advance.y;


	// the charcode that will be associated with that glyph in the set
	gid = charcode;

	// copying the pixels from the FreeType glyph
	int stride = (ginfo.width+3)&amp;~3;
	uint8_t *tmpbitmap = calloc(sizeof(uint8_t),stride*ginfo.height);
	int y;
	for (y = 0; y &lt; ginfo.height; y++)
		memcpy(tmpbitmap+y*stride, bitmap-&gt;buffer+y*ginfo.width, ginfo.width);

	// finally adding it to the xcb_render_glyphset_t gs
	xcb_render_add_glyphs_checked(c,
		gs, 1, &amp;gid, &amp;ginfo, stride*ginfo.height, tmpbitmap);
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>Until now we’ve discovered these things in this section:</p>
<ul>
  <li>What composition operations are</li>
  <li>What a “picture” structure is and how it links drawables to the operations</li>
  <li>How a glyphset structure can be used to store glyphs converted from
Freetype format to something xcb understands in its composition library</li>
</ul>

<p>The next step is to take those glyphs and use them to draw some text. To
do that we are also going to require the aid of some helper functions.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	// we now have a text stream - a bunch of glyphs basically
	xcb_render_util_composite_text_stream_t *ts =
		xcb_render_util_composite_text_stream(
				gs, // the glyphset
				text.length, 0);

	// prepare the text at a certain positions in the stream
	xcb_render_util_glyphs_32(ts, x, y, text.length, text.str);

	// finally render using the repeated pen color on the picture
	// (which is related to the pixmap)
	xcb_render_util_composite_text(
		c, // connection
		XCB_RENDER_PICT_OP_OVER, //op
		fg_pen, // src
		picture, // dst
		0, // fmt
		0, // src x
		0, // src y
		ts); // txt stream
</code></pre>
</div>

<p>That helper function is the <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcb_render_util_composite_text</code> which
executes a composition operation <code class="highlighter-rouge">OVER</code> (draws over without any merging)
from a picture containing some simple color (<code class="highlighter-rouge">fg_pen</code> is a 1x1 pixel
colored pictured) to the final picture destination we want (the one that
has the drawable on it). This function requires a text stream object,
which can be created from the glyphset we’ve built beforehand and from
some text we want to write.</p>

<p>(NB: As stated <a href="https://p.janouch.name/article-xgb.html">here</a> this only
supports drawing ~252 glyphs at a time)</p>

<p>This is what happens in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">xcb_render_util_glyphs_32</code> call, the
glyphset that was already loaded in the text stream is asked to load
the characters from a string (<code class="highlighter-rouge">text.str</code> in this case). The <code class="highlighter-rouge">_32</code>
prepending the function indicates that this text is in Ucs4 format,
there are also <code class="highlighter-rouge">_16</code> postfix for UTF-16 and <code class="highlighter-rouge">_8</code> for UTF-8 format. The
text conversion functions can found in the fontconfig library, as
mentioned before, so we don’t have to worry about those. (<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/software/fontconfig/fontconfig-devel/x103.html#AEN5067">String
utilities</a>)</p>

<p>And that’s it, at this point we’ll have our characters drawn on the
drawable using whatever font we wanted!</p>

<p>…Also don’t forget to clean up afterwards.</p>

<div class="highlighter-rouge"><pre class="highlight"><code>	xcb_render_util_composite_text_free(ts);
	xcb_render_free_picture(c, picture);
	xcb_render_free_picture(c, fg_pen);
	xcb_render_util_disconnect(c);
</code></pre>
</div>

<h3 id="extra---font-fallback">Extra - Font fallback</h3>

<p>There’s the edge case of font fallback we haven’t mentioned. What if you
load a font with FreeType and when the time comes to get the glyph index
of that character you can’t find it (glyph_index == 0). That character
won’t be drawn on the screen or it’ll be drawn with the default box that
shows non-support.</p>

<p>The way to handle that is to let the user of the function pass a list of
search patterns and switch to the next font in the list when fontconfig
says that the font doesn’t have the character needed to be drawn.</p>

<h3 id="wrappers-for-merging-things-together-in-an-easy-library">Wrappers for merging things together in an easy library</h3>

<p>All that’s left is to wrap everything nicely in an easy to use wrapper
tying everything together.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>The process can be summarized by this list:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Fontconfig
    <ul>
      <li>Build a search query for fontconfig</li>
      <li>Let fontconfig substitute within that pattern to fill the default query parameters</li>
      <li>Match the font using fontconfig</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Freetype
    <ul>
      <li>Load the face</li>
      <li>Fetch the glyph_index for the character needed</li>
      <li>Get the bitmap related</li>
      <li>Get the advance in x and y position</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
  <li>Rendering
    <ul>
      <li>Create a picture linking composition to drawable</li>
      <li>Create a glyphset to contain the glyph information</li>
      <li>Convert the glyph information from the bitmap Freetype format to XCB format</li>
      <li>Create a text stream using the glyphset to facilitate drawing</li>
      <li>Tell the text stream to draw some specific text</li>
      <li>Composite the stream on the picture</li>
    </ul>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Again the implementation can be found at the
<a href="https://github.com/venam/fonts-for-xcb">font-for-xcb</a> project, it’s
not perfect but it can be used as an example for later work and reference.</p>

<p>Let’s hope this is going to help understand how the fonts are drawn on
the X window system and Unix. Cheers!</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://singpolyma.net/2018/09/rust-factory-without-box-trait-object/">Rust Factory Without Box (Trait Object)</a>

<span class="date">September 01, 2018 05:52 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I&#8217;ve been playing around a lot with <a href="https://www.rust-lang.org/">Rust</a> recently and it&#8217;s quickly becoming my second-favourite programming language.  One of the things I&#8217;ve been playing with is some Object Oriented design concepts as they might apply.  For example, consider this code:</p>
<pre><code>fn format_year(n: i32) -&gt; String {
	if n == 0 {
		"0 is not a year".to_string()
	} else if n &lt; 0 {
		format!("{} BC", -n)
	} else {
		format!("{} AD", n)
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>While maybe overkill for this small example, let&#8217;s go ahead and <a href="https://refactoring.guru/replace-conditional-with-polymorphism">replace conditional with polymorphism</a>:</p>
<pre><code>fn format_year(n: Box&lt;Year&gt;) -&gt; String {
	format!("{} {}", n.year(), n.era())
}

trait Year {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32;
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}

impl Year {
	fn new(n: i32) -&gt; Box&lt;Year&gt; {
		if n == 0 {
			Box::new(YearZero())
		} else if n &lt; 0 {
			Box::new(YearBC(-n as u32))
		} else {
			Box::new(YearAD(n as u32))
		}
	}
}

struct YearZero();

impl Year for YearZero {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { 0 }
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String { "is not a year".to_string() }
}

struct YearBC(u32);

impl Year for YearBC {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.0 }
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String { "BC".to_string() }
}

struct YearAD(u32);

impl Year for YearAD {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.0 }
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String { "AD".to_string() }
}</code></pre>
<p>This works, and really does seem to mimic the way this kind of design looks in a class-based Object Oriented language.  It has a major disadvantage, however: all our objects are on the heap now (which is likely to cause performance issues).  In some cases, this can be fixed by using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuation-passing_style">CPS</a> so that the trait objects could be borrowed references instead of boxed, but that&#8217;s both ugly and not always an option.  One other design might be to use an enum:</p>
<pre><code>fn format_year(n: Year) -&gt; String {
	format!("{} {}", n.year(), n.era())
}

enum Year {
	YearZero,
	YearBC(u32),
	YearAD(u32)
}

impl Year {
	fn new(n: i32) -&gt; Year {
		if n == 0 {
			Year::YearZero
		} else if n &lt; 0 {
			Year::YearBC(-n as u32)
		} else {
			Year::YearAD(n as u32)
		}
	}

	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
		match self {
			YearZero =&gt; 0,
			YearBC(y) =&gt; y,
			YearAD(y) =&gt; y
		}
	}

	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 {
		match self {
			YearZero =&gt; "is not a year".to_string(),
			YearBC(y) =&gt; "BC".to_string(),
			YearAD(y) =&gt; "AD".to_string()
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>No more heap allocations!  While this is obviously analogous, some might claim we haven&#8217;t actually &#8220;replaced conditional&#8221; at all, though we have at least contained the conditionals in a place where a type only knows about itself, and not about other things that might get passed in.  Even if you accept adding match arms on <code>self</code> as &#8220;extension&#8221;, in terms of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Open%E2%80%93closed_principle">open/closed</a> this requires a modification to at <em>least</em> the enum and the factory to add a new case, instead of just the factory as with the trait version.</p>
<p>What is it about the enum version that allows us to avoid the boxing?  Well, an enum knows what all the possibilities are, and so the compiler can know the size that needs to be reserved to store any one of those.  With the trait case, the compiler can&#8217;t know how big the infinite world of possibilities that might implement that trait could be, and so cannot know the size to be reserved: we have to defer that to runtime and use a box.  <em>However</em>, the factory will always actually return only a known list of trait implementations&#8230; can we exploit that to know the size somehow?  What if we create an enum of the structs from the trait version and have the factory return <em>that</em>?</p>
<pre><code>enum YearEnum {
	YearZero(YearZero),
	YearBC(YearBC),
	YearAD(YearAD)
}

impl Year {
	fn new(n: i32) -&gt; YearEnum {
		if n == 0 {
			YearEnum::YearZero(YearZero())
		} else if n &lt; 0 {
			YearEnum::YearBC(YearBC(-n as u32))
		} else {
			YearEnum::YearAD(YearAD(n as u32))
		}
	}
}

impl std::ops::Deref for YearEnum {
	type Target = Year;

	fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Target {
		match self {
			YearEnum::YearZero(x) =&gt; x,
			YearEnum::YearBC(x) =&gt; x,
			YearEnum::YearAD(x) =&gt; x
		}
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>impl std::ops::Deref</code> will allow us to call any method in the <code>Year</code> trait on the enum as returned from the factory, allowing this to effectively act as a trait object, but with no heap allocations!  This seems like exactly what we want, but it&#8217;s a lot of boilerplate.  Luckily, it&#8217;s very mechanical so creating a macro to do this for us is fairly easy (and I&#8217;ll throw in a bunch of other obvious trait implementations while we&#8217;re at it):</p>
<pre><code>macro_rules! trait_enum {
	($trait:ident, $enum:ident, $( $item:ident ) , *) =&gt; {
		enum $enum {
			$(
				$item($item),
			)*
		}

		impl std::ops::Deref for $enum {
			type Target = $trait;

			fn deref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;Self::Target {
				match self {
					$(
						$enum::$item(x) =&gt; x,
					)*
				}
			}
		}

		impl From&lt;$enum&gt; for Box&lt;$trait&gt; {
			fn from(input: $enum) -&gt; Self {
				match input {
					$(
						$enum::$item(x) =&gt; Box::new(x),
					)*
				}
			}
		}

		impl&lt;'a&gt; From&lt;&amp;'a $enum&gt; for &amp;'a $trait {
			fn from(input: &amp;'a $enum) -&gt; Self {
				&amp;**input
			}
		}

		impl&lt;'a&gt; AsRef&lt;$trait + 'a&gt; for $enum {
			fn as_ref(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;($trait + 'a) {
				&amp;**self
			}
		}

		impl&lt;'a&gt; std::borrow::Borrow&lt;$trait + 'a&gt; for $enum {
			fn borrow(&amp;self) -&gt; &amp;($trait + 'a) {
				&amp;**self
			}
		}

		$(
			impl From&lt;$item&gt; for $enum {
				fn from(input: $item) -&gt; Self {
					$enum::$item(input)
				}
			}
		)*
	}
}</code></pre>
<p>And now to repeat the first refactoring, but with the help of this new macro:</p>
<pre><code>fn format_year&lt;Y: Year + ?Sized&gt;(n: &amp;Y) -&gt; String {
	format!("{} {}", n.year(), n.era())
}

trait Year {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32;
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String;
}

trait_enum!(Year, YearEnum, YearZero, YearBC, YearAD);

impl Year {
	fn new(n: i32) -&gt; YearEnum {
		if n == 0 {
			YearZero().into()
		} else if n &lt; 0 {
			YearBC(-n as u32).into()
		} else {
			YearAD(n as u32).into()
		}
	}
}

struct YearZero();

impl Year for YearZero {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { 0 }
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String { "is not a year".to_string() }
}

struct YearBC(u32);

impl Year for YearBC {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.0 }
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String { "BC".to_string() }
}

struct YearAD(u32);

impl Year for YearAD {
	fn year(&amp;self) -&gt; u32 { self.0 }
	fn era(&amp;self) -&gt; String { "AD".to_string() }
}</code></pre>
<p>We do still have two places with must be modified rather than extended (the macro invocation and the factory), but all other code can be written ignorant of those and in the same style as using a normal trait object.  The normal trait objects can even be recovered using various implementations the macro creates, or even just by doing <code>&amp;*</code> on the enum.  Benchmarking these three styles on a somewhat more complex example actually found this last one to also be the most performant (though only marginally faster than the pure-enum approach), and the boxed-trait-object style to be more than three times slower.</p>
<p>So there you go, next time you ask yourself if you want the flexibility of a trait or the size guarantees and performance of an enum, maybe grab a macro and say: why not both!</p>

<div class="content">
<p>I bought a nicely refurbrished Thinkpad X230 and it came with Windows 7.</p>

<div>
<a href="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blog/img/x230.jpg"><img src="http://feeds.feedburner.com/blog/img/x230_thumb.jpg" width="400px" height="400px" alt="Lenovo x230" /></a>
</div>

<p>My idea is to install Ubuntu and OpenBSD, but I wanted to keep Windows in a small partition. 
I want to benchmark performance and battery life on the three systems.</p>

<p>Having not used any Windows version for 17 years, I
faced this task with an open mind. Surely Windows is not going to suck after all these years, right?</p>

<p>This is what happened:</p>

<ol>
<li>Unbox the laptop and boot it up</li>
<li>Windows First Launch Assistant asks me a few questions. Windows 7 boots to desktop. There is some Lenovo crapware installed but I'll deal with that later.</li>
<li>"You have updates, do you want to apply them?". Yes, I do. I don't want to use a Windows box on the Internet without the latest patches</li>
<li>It takes about 3 hours to download updates, installing them and rebooting. I think the laptop rebooted at least four times. Unaware of what would come next, I think "wow this is a terrible first-run experience for a novice user"</li>
<li>Suddenly, in the middle of an update, I get a BSOD. Some things never change I guess. I regret not having taken a picture.</li>
<li>After restarting, it seems some config or dll is broken and most apps don't run. The system is basically unusable</li>
<li>I download the official <a href="https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=20858">System Update Readiness Tool For Windows 7</a> which is a 500MB download that supposedly fixes this specific problem.</li>
<li>SURTFW7 hangs while it is installing the fix. I realize I am screwed.</li>
<li>I try to get back to a "restoration point" but none was created</li>
<li>At this point I am resigned to reinstall from scratch</li>
<li>I launch the Lenovo Factory Recover utility and produces a non-bootable USB disk</li>
<li>I boot from the recovery partition. The option to reset to factory disk/settings does not work</li>
<li>Twitter friends tell me that the smartest thing to do is to <a href="http://forum.notebookreview.com/threads/nbr-windows-10-clean-installation-guide.781178/">download a Windows 10 ISO and nuke the old installation</a> </li>
</ol>

<p>Thanks for a fantastic first time experience, Microsoft! 👌🏼</p>

<p>P.S. I have a Windows 10 key so I won't need to download a torrent but that's beside the point.</p>

<div>~~~~~~</div>

<p>Update: Indeed, I installed Windows 10. Then it took me about two hours to adjust all the settings
and remove the telemetry "features". Since then, I've been sitting in front of the computer, waiting
while it installs updates and reboots.</p>

<p>It has taken me <strong>two full days</strong> to get a new Windows laptop running, and I'm a fairly
technical person. 
What on earth is Windows doing for hours and hours? It literally takes less time to fill in the
whole disk with randomly generated bytes.</p>

<p>Ubuntu installed flawlessly and had all drivers working without any manual intervention.
Updating to the latest patches took about three minutes and one reboot.</p>

<p>No wonder regular people hate Windows. It is, without a doubt, the worst, most
frustrating computing experience I've had in the last ten years.</p>

<p>If you already have read some of my earlier posts, you will know that I currently work remotely and am part of a team that is spread across a few countries.</p>
<p>For this reason I try to read a lot about the subject, in order to try to continuously the way we work.  On this post I just want to share 2 links (one video and an article) that I think can be very helpful for remote teams, even though they address subjects that are common to everyone.</p>
<p>So here they are:</p>
<h5><a href="https://medium.com/@kawomersley/documenting-decisions-in-a-remote-team-b53cb615ae73">Documenting Decisions in a Remote Team </a></h5>
<p>This is very important specifically the parts of making sure everyone is in the loop, explicitly communicating the ownership of the decision and keeping a record that can be consulted in the future.</p>
<p>Read on <a href="https://medium.com/@kawomersley/documenting-decisions-in-a-remote-team-b53cb615ae73">Medium</a></p>
<h5><a href="https://businessofsoftware.wistia.com/medias/leii8vj2s4">Building Operating Cadence With Remote Teams</a></h5>
<p>This is a more general presentation where it is explained how things work at Zapier (100% remote team). One good idea from the video that caught my attention is the small &#8220;survey&#8221; before the meetings, to define the plan and allowing people to get more context before the meeting starts.</p>

<p>I am a big fan of using tools to find problems quickly.  Polishing the draft material for my <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR/">evidence-based software engineering book</a>, I have been finding an annoying number of grammatical mistakes :-(.</p>
<p><a href="https://www.languagetool.org/">LanguageTool</a> is what I use to check my grammar; it is the best tool of its kind that I know, and supports lots of different languages.</p>
<p>I also have an <a href="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/code-data/chkdbl.awk">awk script</a> that looks for new instances of previous mistakes I have made.  It rarely flags anything, I seem to be in a continual state of making new grammatical mistakes.</p>
<p>Stung by a recent series is blatant mistakes, I have been searching for a better tool.  What did I find:</p>
<ul>
<li>The <a href="https://www.comp.nus.edu.sg/~nlp/conll14st.html">2014 Conference on Computational Natural Language Learning</a> shared task was grammatical error correction,</li>
<li>a bibliography of <a href="http://grammatical.github.io/publications/">papers on grammatical error correction</a>,</li>
<li>LMGEC-Lite<a href="https://github.com/chrisjbryant/lmgec-lite"></a>: the latest research tool (I will download the <a href="http://www.statmt.org/lm-benchmark/">Billion Word Benchmark dataset</a>, to build the 4G training dataset, from which the 10G language model is created, another day),</li>
<li>a machine translation approach that <a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1804.05945">automates grammatical error correction</a>, i.e., rewrites what has been written.  Perhaps I should use this tool on some of the software engineering papers I read, it could not make them any worse.</li>
</ul>
<p>So, lots of interesting stuff, but nothing better that is usable.</p>
<p>I keep looking at the <a href="https://spacy.io/models/">interesting things that spaCY</a> can do (if you are looking to integrate language processing in your app, spaCY is currently the best language processing library).  Does anybody know of grammar checking work being done using spaCY (LanguageTool is based around a parsing engine that is rather long in the tooth now)?</p>
<p>Anybody interested in organizing a grammar checking tool hack day in London?</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/2018-08-30-mitogen-03-xmit.html">Transmit optimisations in Mitogen 0.3</a>

<span class="date">August 30, 2018 06:12 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>An early goal for <a href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/">Mitogen</a> was to
make it simple to retrofit, avoiding any "opinionated" choices likely to cause
needless or impossible changes in downstream code. Despite being internally
asynchronous, a blocking and mostly thread-safe API is exposed, with management
of the asynchrony punted to a thread, making integrating with a deployment
script hopefully as easy as with a GUI.</p>
<p>Although rough edges remain due to this, such as struggles with subprocess
reaping, based on experience working on <a href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html">Mitogen for
Ansible</a> and ignoring
complexities unique to that environment, the design appears to mostly function
as intended.</p>
<p><em>Mostly</em> being operative as, due to the API choice, and despite gains already
witnessed in the extension, some internals remain overly simplistic. Naturally
as has been the lesson throughout, this of course means inefficient:
horrifyingly, crying-in-the-shower inefficient.</p>
<p><a href="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/2018-08-27-fork-in-the-road.html">While recently</a>
attacking some of Ansible's grosser naivities, now the excesses of continuous
forking are gone, dirty laundry is again visible on Mitogen's side. This post
describes one offender: message transmission and routing, how it looks today,
why it is a tragedy, and how things will improve.</p>

</ul>

<p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
<p>To recap, communication with a bootstrapped child is
<a href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/howitworks.html#stream-protocol">message-oriented</a>
to escape the limitations of stream-oriented IO. When an application makes a
call, the sending thread enqueues a message with the broker thread, which is
responsible for all IO, then sleeps waiting for the broker to deliver a reply.</p>
<p>This has many benefits: mutually ignorant threads can share a child without
coordination, since a central broker exists behind the scenes. Errors can only
occur on the broker thread, so handling is not spread throughout user code.</p>
<p><strong>Message Transmission</strong></p>
<p>Examining just the Mitogen aspects of transmission for an SSH-connected Ansible
target, below are the rough steps repeated for every message in the stable
branch.</p>
<p><img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mitogen-03-xmit/xmitpath1.png" /><br />
Despite removing most system calls to fit things in one diagram, there is still
plenty to absorb, and clearly many parts to what is conceptually a simple task.
A component called <code>Waker</code> abstracts waking the broker thread. This
implements a variant of the <a href="https://cr.yp.to/docs/selfpipe.html">UNIX self-pipe
trick</a>, waking it by writing to a pipe it
is sleeping on.</p>
<p>When the broker wakes, it calls waker's <code>on_receive</code> handler,
causing any deferred functions to execute on its thread. Here the asynchronous
half of the router runs, picking a stream to forward the message.</p>
<p>The stream responds by asking the broker to tell it when the SSH stream becomes
writeable, which is implemented differently depending on OS, but in most cases
it entails yet more system calls.</p>
<p>Since usually the SSH input buffer is empty, the broker immediately wakes again
to call the stream's <code>on_transmit</code> handler, finally passing the
message to SSH before marking the stream unwriteable again. At this point
execution moves to SSH, for little than to read from a socket, do some crypto
and write to another socket.</p>
<p><strong>Better Message Transmission</strong></p>
<p>In total transmission requires at least 2 task switches, 2 loop iterations, at
least 5 reads/writes, and 2 poller reconfigurations.</p>
<p>While superficially logical, one problem is already obvious: transmitting
always entails waking a thread, a nontrivial operation on UNIX. Another is the
biggest performance bottleneck, the IO loop, is forced to iterate twice for
every transmission, in part to cope with the possibility the SSH input buffer
is full.</p>
<p>What if we were more optimistic: an error won't occur, and the SSH input buffer
probably has space. Since we aren't expecting to cleanup a failure, there is no
reason to involve the broker either. The new sequence:</p>
<p><img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mitogen-03-xmit/xmitpath2.png" /><br />
Coordination is replaced with a lock, and the sending thread writes directly to
SSH. We no longer check for writeability: simply try the write and if it fails,
or buffered data exists, defer to the broker like before.</p>
<p>Now we have 1 task switch, 0 loop iterations, 2 lock operations, 3
reads/writes, and 0 poller reconfigurations, but still there is that unsightly
task switch.</p>
<p><strong>Even Better Message Transmission</strong></p>
<p>The Ansible extension and <a href="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/2018-08-27-fork-in-the-road.html">new strategy
work</a> both offer
something Ansible previously relied on SSH multiplexing to provide: a process
where connection state persists during a run. As persistence is under our
control, one final step becomes possible. Simply move SSH in-process:</p>
<p><img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mitogen-03-xmit/xmitpath3.png" /><br />
Now we have 0 task switches, 0 loop iterations, 2 lock operations, 1 write, and
0 poller reconfigurations, or simply put, the minimum possible to support a
threaded program communicating via SSH.</p>
<p>Some exciting possibilities emerge: passwords can be typed without allocating a
PTY. Since usually <a href="https://github.com/dw/mitogen/issues/337">Linux only supports 4,096
PTYs</a>, this raises the scalability
upper bound while reducing resource usage. Much better buffering is possible,
eliminating Mitogen's own buffer, and optimally sizing SSH sockets to <a href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/dmw/internals.html#mitogen.core.CHUNK_SIZE">support
file
transfers</a>.</p>
<p>Of course downsides exist: unlike <a href="https://www.libssh.org/">libssh</a> or
<a href="https://libssh2.org/">libssh2</a>, OpenSSH is part of a typical workflow,
supports every authentication style, and it is common to stash configuration in
<code>~/.ssh/config</code>. Although libssh supports SSH configuration parsing,
it's unclear how well it works in practice, and at least the author of
<a href="https://parallel-ssh.org/">ParallelSSH</a> (and wrappers for both libraries)
appears to have chosen libssh2 over it for reasons I'd like to discover.</p>
<p><strong>Routing</strong></p>
<p>For completeness, and since the diagrams exist already, here is routing between
two SSH children from the context of their parent on the stable branch:</p>
<p><img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mitogen-03-xmit/route1.png" /><br />
While internal switching is avoided, those nasty loop iterations are visible,
as are the surrounding task switches. Optimistic sending benefits routing too:</p>
<p><img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mitogen-03-xmit/route2.png" /><br />
Now the loop iterates once. Finally, with an in-process SSH client:</p>
<p><img src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/mitogen-03-xmit/route3.png" /><br />
A single thread is woken, receives the message to be forwarded, delivers it,
and sleeps all on one stack.</p>
<p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
<p>Complexity is fractal, but shying from it just leads to mediocre software. Both
improvements exist as branches, and both will be supported by the Ansible
extension in addition to the new work.</p>
<p>Until next time!</p></div>

<p>In an attempt to get a wider range of testing for <code>lang/node</code>, I have decided
to make test builds available here on <a href="https://deftly.net/pub/OpenBSD">deftly.net</a>.</p>

<p>If you want to test node, but don&rsquo;t want to build the package yourself, you
can simply run the following to upgrade your current install:</p>

<pre><code>env PKG_PATH=https://deftly.net/pub/OpenBSD/snapshots/packages/$(machine) pkg_add -u node
</code></pre>

<p>All the packages pushed here will be signed via <a href="https://man.openbsd.org/signify">signify(1)</a>.</p>

<p>To make use of the signing, you will have to copy the below pub key to
<code>/etc/signify/abieber-pkg.pub</code></p>

<img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/662/1*tuISZaQQ4D6DC9qJQNB_tA.png" /><p>Previous chapter we went over why we should give Vue a go, link below.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/@wesharehoodies/from-zero-to-hero-with-vue-why-vue-8c7e981b494">From zero to hero with Vue — Why Vue?</a></p><p>Alright! Let’s get our hands dirty! All we need is a text editor and a browser. I will be using Visual Studio Code paired with Google Chrome.</p><h3>Table of contents:</h3><ul><li>Getting started, understanding the basics, “hello world”</li><li>Directives</li><li>Methods</li><li>Conditional statements</li></ul><h3>“Hello World”</h3><p>Let’s begin by opening the terminal and creating a folder called zero-to-hero-vue — This is where our Vue application will live. Create a index.html and app.js inside the folder as well.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1016/1*DAlpDY8tCQFkUBUE-66XRw.png" />Creating our folder and index.html<p>Instead of writing the basic html boilerplate, we can utilise <a href="https://emmet.io/">emmet</a>. Emmet is built-in for VSC.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/784/1*1_oDUytKP9hm12A9JoAv9w.gif" /><strong>!</strong> + <strong>Tab</strong> inside a .html file creates the boilerplate<p><a href="https://emmet.io/">Emmet - the essential toolkit for web-developers</a></p><p>In case you’re curious for more emmet tips and hotkeys, here’s the full cheat-sheet.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*XU0d2SvR-KbYQj1OK8ToYA.png" /><a href="https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/">https://docs.emmet.io/cheat-sheet/</a><p>We’re going to start off by including the Vue library as an external script. We’re going to use a module bundler later on, for now let’s keep it simple.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*fuikEcoIYg1p3ikQoeXLBw.png" /><p>Include this script after the body tags, make sure it’s first in order always.</p><a href="https://medium.com/media/c50d9a9fbb3a3b0e9bca2ba567848c7c/href">https://medium.com/media/c50d9a9fbb3a3b0e9bca2ba567848c7c/href</a><p>Nifty! Make sure to link app.js with the index.html too.</p><p>Every Vue application starts by creating a new Vue instance with the Vue constructor. We bind the Vue instance to a root element, #app in this case.</p><p><a href="https://medium.com/js-dojo/whats-the-deal-with-vue-s-virtual-dom-3ed4fc0dbb20">Vue uses a virtual DOM</a>. The vDOM needs to be “mounted” to a DOM element.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/604/1*NY6IZVL3uqBCgx2jTyAmug.png" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*afgoJjXscDiBtb6SsgOpOg.png" />initializing the vue app<p>We created a new Vue instance. We bound the Vue instance to the div with the id of app — think of this as our root element. At the bottom we included the app.js script.</p><p>That’s all there is! We can immediately start writing reactive code.</p><p>Next up is the data property. The data property is the meant for storing our application data… hey logical right? Think of as equivalent as this.props.data from React world. Inside the data property we can declare our properties we want to use in our app, let’s make one called message</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*jyRLG7A4ta4GJXUddpl5VA.png" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/974/1*jDECc6C6cuuzLsFvNe02Gw.png" />Inside the <strong>#app</strong> div we can use Javascript expressions since this is where we initialised our Vue app.<p>Notice the curly brackets inside the index.html — Vue.js uses an HTML-based template syntax that allows you to declaratively bind the rendered DOM to the underlying Vue instance’s data. All Vue.js templates are valid HTML that can be parsed by spec-compliant browsers and HTML parsers.</p><p><a href="https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/syntax.html">Template Syntax - Vue.js</a></p><p>When a Vue instance is created, it adds all the properties found in its data object to Vue’s reactivity system. When the values of those properties change, the view will “react”, updating to match the new values.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*Kdp4sQehJJBVTe6II7ch_g.png" />index.html<img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*BynA_1DVcsOlW0QEzGL0tg.png" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*xcGltp6pRq17pXCTf6Iihw.png" /><a href="https://gist.github.com/staltz/868e7e9bc2a7b8c1f754">“The introduction to Reactive Programming you’ve been missing”</a><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*DrPXKI9ImiaRuXmswMyDHg.gif" /><h3>Directives</h3><p>Vue uses attributes called directives. Directives are a simple way to keep the user interface and data in sync.</p><p>Directives are prefixed with v- to indicate that they are special attributes provided by Vue, and as you may have guessed, they apply special reactive behavior to the rendered DOM. Here, it is basically saying “keep this element’s title attribute up-to-date with the message property on the Vue instance.”</p><p>Let’s add a span with a Vue directive.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/808/1*KkCdjmOrBRhbXI-6BTEIhA.png" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*8CL8lpHS7KFgnnggL7fBkQ.png" /><p>The syntax for a directive is easy to understand. Vue will look for a vue inside the data property. The title attribute is from plain html, if you hover over the title attribute, a hidden text will be shown. It’s mostly used for acronyms and definitions.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*h5bsV5y5Qmcm7GhO7vWwaw.gif" />Notice when hovering the text, a title will appear<p><em>Bonus tip: </em>There’s a shorthand for the v-bind syntax. We can remove the v-bind completely and be left with the :title</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/894/1*qEfHS1QgTUr1mQ6PNCaE-g.png" />:title is the same as v-bind:title<p>If you feel confused, please let me know in the comments and I will try to explain it better. ❤</p><h3>Methods</h3><p>Every application has buttons, inputs, etc for interactivity. Letting the user interact with the app is the very core of any application.</p><p>Let’s create a button which logs our message to the console.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*L7vO-fGGOmLoDCUWPt6ImA.png" /><p>Notice we created a new Vue property called methods. This is where we will place our methods.</p><p>The this keyword within Vue gives you easy access to all of your data and functionalities. Wether you want to access a data property, a computed property, a component prop or a function, you can all find them directly bound to the this keyword.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/978/1*LTya3IOzvvJqVM063DDJDQ.png" /><p>We created a button with the directive v-on:click and passed in our method name as a string. Just like we do with plain Javascript.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*AP-0225EdV9oBsQslkV2gw.gif" />Calling our logMessage method<p>Works like a charm!</p><p><em>Bonus tip: </em>Shorthand for v-on:click is @click</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/806/1*foTr3Eh1aCg4n2UN0kFjiA.png" />@click is the equivalent to v-on:click<img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*PngUC1W2frXO5OyF2CqGmQ.png" /><h3>Conditional statements</h3><p>Conditionals and loops are the very essentials of building useful applications. All conditionals go under the logic of “what happens when?” — if, else, else if, try, catch, etc are all conditional statements.</p><p>Let’s create the following conditional — if we have a message, show it, if not, don’t show it.</p><p>To get started we’re going to create a boolean property inside our data object.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*O41KsPX3fs1wCXecNzta0g.png" />We added a new property: hasMessage: true<p>Next up we can use a directive called v-if inside our markup.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rjp8Eked5-06ATpRic6aiQ.png" /><p>You got it! If we look at our browser, nothing has changed. This is because we set the showMessage property to true. In case you’re curious, v-else and v-if-else are valid conditionals too.</p><p>Let’s create a method which toggles the showMessage property. <strong>Try using what we learned earlier to do this by yourself. You can do it!</strong></p><h4>Ready?</h4><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rOGRWj2CriO_JGUiuFeybA.png" /><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/964/1*NAMVbuYWkbHp773_PvDmPw.png" /><p>Adding a simple method which toggles our showMessage property and including it in our view.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*WCQjZV-y9-fw8-n_23FU2A.gif" />Toggling the message<p>Congratulations for making it this far!

I always base my reasoning on rationale and practicality.</p><p>Remember, these are tools which help us get the job done more efficiently, so you need to pick the right tool for the right job. If you have a hammer everything looks like a nail. Recognising which tool is suitable for the task can save you a lot of time and money in the long run.</p><p>Here are couple reasons to pick Vue</p><ul><li><strong>Short and sweet learning curve, easy to get up and running: </strong>Getting up and running with Vue is quite straightforward. You don’t need to use a module bundler like Webpack or <a href="https://medium.freecodecamp.org/all-you-need-to-know-about-parcel-dbe151b70082">Parcel</a>. You also don’t need a module bundler for React. Removing the need for module bundlers reduces the barriers to getting started.</li><li><strong>Strong open-source community: </strong>Learning a framework is a huge investment and we want to make sure we’re learning the right tool at the right time.</li></ul><p>Whilst React and Angular are backed by big companies, Vue is <strong>mostly</strong> backed by a very active open source community.</p><p>A single entity deciding what to do with a widely used tool is actually riskier than a non-traditional, corporate-backed tool.</p><p>Let’s say company X builds and maintains tool Z. What happens if company X goes bust and decides to close doors? What happens if they decide to “re-allocate resources” and ditch the project?</p><p>Judging by the Patreon page, the core Vue team is well-off and the project has super long term goals.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*rOGT4rXH6T0ybpXPwjsdeA.png" /><a href="https://www.patreon.com/evanyou">https://www.patreon.com/evanyou</a><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*NUlWwWSIGU_yfXfsTvWK0A.png" /><a href="https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/BACKERS.md">https://github.com/vuejs/vue/blob/dev/BACKERS.md</a><ul><li><strong>Friendly migration path for legacy projects that don’t want to commit 100% to a single page app (SPA): </strong>Dropping Vue in a project and slowly migrating a huge monolithic application to a single page app is a proven path.</li></ul><p>I had a great conversation with a technical executive for an established SaaS startup. The startup has a product and is making revenue. The conversation went as follows:</p><ul><li><strong>Me:</strong> Why Vue? I’m fascinated since it’s not a traditional tech choice in this city. Why not React or Angular since there are more React and Angular developers around here?</li><li><strong>Founder:</strong> We are a small team with no dedicated frontend expert. We want to rewrite our frontend, add new features and clean up code. <strong>We don’t want to commit rewriting completely yet</strong>. Using Vue with our monolithic application and writing new features works great for us.</li></ul><p><strong>Vue plays well with existing server side rendered (SSR) applications like Rails, Laravel or Node.</strong></p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/618/1*N7iYuWWnW5rwZfvup6ubrg.png" />Vue gets along well with SSR apps<ul><li><strong>Learning Vue is fun: </strong>This my favourite reason to learn Vue.

<h4><a href="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/2018-08-27-fork-in-the-road.html">A fork in the road for Mitogen</a>

<span class="date">August 27, 2018 01:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><a href="https://mitogen.readthedocs.io/en/stable/ansible.html">Mitogen for Ansible</a>'s
original plan described facets of a scheme centered on features made possible
by a rigorous single cohesive distributed program model, but of those facets,
it quickly became clear that most users are really only interested in the big
one: a much faster Ansible.</p>
<p>While I'd prefer feature work, this priority is fine: better performance
usually entails enhancements that benefit the overall scheme, and improving
people's lives in this manner is highly rewarding, so incentives remain
aligned. It is impossible not to find renewed energy when faced with comments
like this:</p>
<blockquote>
    Enabling the mitogen plugin in ansible feels like switching from floppy to SSD<br />
    <a href="https://t.co/nCshkioX9h">https://t.co/nCshkioX9h</a>
</blockquote>

<p>Although feedback on the project has been very positive, the existing solution
is sometimes not enough. Limitations in the extension and Ansible really bite,
most often manifesting when running against many targets. In these scenarios,
it is heartbreaking to see the work fail to help those who could benefit from
it most, and that's what I'd like to talk about.</p>
<p><strong>Controller-side Performance</strong></p>
<p>Some time ago I began refactoring Ansible's
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/2.5/user_guide/playbooks_strategies.html">linear</a>
strategy, aiming to get it to where controller-side enhancements might exist
without adding more spaghetti, while becoming familiar with requirements for
later features. To recap, the strategy plugin is responsible for almost every
post-parsing task, including worker management. It is in many ways the beating
heart at the core of every Ansible run.</p>
<p>After some months and one particularly enlightening conversation that work was
resumed, eventually subsuming all of the remaining strategy support and result
processing code, forming one huge refactor of a big chunk of upstream that has
been gathering dust for almost a month.</p>
<p>The result exists today and is truly wonderful. It integrates Mitogen into the
heart of Ansible without baking it in, introduces a carefully designed process
model with strong persistence properties, eliminating most bottlenecks endured
by the extension and vanilla Ansible, and provides an architectural basis for
the next planned iteration of scalability work, Windows compatibility, some
features mentioned, and quite a few that have been kept quiet.</p>
<p>With the new strategy it is possible to almost perfectly saturate an 8 vCPU
machine given 100 targets, with minimal loss of speedup compared to
single-target. Regarding single target, simple loops against localhost are up
to 4x faster than the current stable extension.</p>
<p>While there are at least 2 obvious additional enhancements possible with this
work, development reached a natural break in order to allow stablizing one
piece of the puzzle at a time. Once this is done, it is clear exactly where to
pick things up next.</p>
<p><strong>Deep Cuts</strong></p>
<p><img width="162" height="405" src="https://sweetness.hmmz.org/images/ansible-stack.svg" align="right" /></p>
<p>There's just a small hitch: this work goes deep, entailing changes that, while
so far would be possible as monkey-patches, are highly version-specific, and
unlikely to remain monkey-patchable as the branch receives real-world usage.
There must be a mechanism to ship unknown future patches to upstream code.</p>
<p>It was hoped it could land after Ansible 2.7, benefitting from related changes
planned upstream, but they appear to have been delayed or abandoned, and so a
situation exists where improvements cannot be shipped for at least another 4-6
months, assuming the related changes finally arrived in Ansible 2.8.</p>
<p>To the right is a rough approximation of components involved in executing a
playbook. Those modified or replaced by the stable extension are green, yellow
are replaced by the branch-in-waiting. Finally in orange are components
affected by planned features and optimizations.</p>
<p>Although there are tens of thousands of lines of surrounding code, as should
hopefully be clear, the number of untouched major components involved in a run
has been dwindling fast. Put simply, the existing mechanism for delivering
improvements is reaching its limit.</p>
<p><strong>The F Word</strong></p>
<p>Any seasoned developer, especially those familiar with the size of the Ansible
code base, will hopefully understand the predicament. There is no problem
delivering improvements today, assuming an unsupported one-off code dump was
all anyone wanted, but that is never the case.</p>
<p>The problem lies in entering an unsustainable permanent marriage with a large
project, not forgetting this outcome was an explicit non-goal from the start.
Simultaneously over the months significant trust has been garnered to deliver
these kinds of improvements, and abandoning one of the best yet would seem
foolish.</p>
<p>Something of a many-variabled optimization process has recently come to an end,
and I've found a solution that I am comfortable with. While making a release
needs more time and may still not be definite, it seemed worth documenting at
least some of the reasoning behind it before it comes.</p>
<p>Even though this outcome was undesirable, and although the solution in mind is
not without restraint, it is still a cloud with many silver linings. For
instance, new user configuration steps can be reduced to almost zero, core
features can be added with minimal friction, and creative limitations are
significantly uncapped.</p>
<p>The key question was how to sustain continued work on a solution that has clear
value to a real problem that plagued upstream since conception. The answer it
turns out, is obvious: the scalability fixes due for release primarily benefit
one type of user.</p>
<p><strong>What about upstream?</strong></p>
<p>Beyond debating strawmen and lines of code, no actionable outcome has ever
materialized, not after carefully worded chain rattling, and not even in the
form of a bug report. If it had, it was always going to at best be a compromise
with an organization that has <a href="https://www.nexedi.com/blog-Improve.the.performance.of.Ansible">delivered consistently worsening performance
every major
release</a> for
the past two and a half years, and it is the principal reason crowdfunding the
extension was the only viable method to deliver real improvements.</p>
<p>The cold reality is that the upstream trend is not a good one: this problem has
existed forever and it is gradually getting worse over time. My best estimate
is that some veterans dislike the solution, perhaps some of those around since
2012 when Michael DeHaan, the project founder, first attempted a <a href="https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/ansible-project/FRKMlsLQpNM/T0X0kQWYckIJ">connection
method uncannily similar to today's
design</a>.</p>
<p>In any case they have an e-mail address, an existing thread to hit Reply to,
and at least two invitations to a telephone call. A conversation requires
interest and initiative, and above all else it requires two parties.</p>
<p><strong>What About The Extension?</strong></p>
<p>The planned structure keeps the extension front-and-centre, so regardless of
outcome it will continue to receive the majority of feature work and
maintenance. It is definitely not going away.</p>
<p>With a third stable release looming, it's probably high time for a quick
update. Many bugs were squashed since July, with stable work recently centered
around problems with Ansible 2.6. This involved some changes to temporary file
handling, and in the process, discovery of a huge missed optimization.</p>
<p>v0.2.3 will need only 2 roundtrips for each
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/copy_module.html">copy</a> and
<a href="https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/modules/template_module.html">template</a>,
or in terms of a 250ms transcontinental link, 10 seconds to copy 20 files vs.
30 seconds previously, or 2 minutes compared to vanilla's best configuration.
This work is delayed somewhat as a new RPC chaining mechanism is added to
better support all similar future changes, and identical situations likely to
appear in similar tools.</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Jumping off after our previous two articles on <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">Voice Leading with Elixir</a>, and <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/08/13/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/">Algorithmically Fingering Guitar Chords with Elixir</a>, we’re left with a series of chord voicings ranked according to how well they voice lead from our starting chord, and the set of all possible fingerings for each of these voicings.</p>

<p>Given that our starting chord has a known fingering, which fingering of each of these “best” voicings is the “easiest” to play after our starting chord?</p>

<p>This is an interesting question, and gives us the opportunity to flex our algorithmic muscles again. This time we’ll be basing our solution on a modified version of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">the Levenshtein distance algorithm</a> for finding the “edit distance” between two strings.</p>

<h2 id="what-is-fingering-distance">What is “Fingering Distance”?</h2>

<p>The term “fingering distance” is my way of referring to how difficult it is to transition from playing one chord on the guitar to another. For example, going from playing a Dm chord on the middle four strings to an Em chord is easy. We just have to slide the shape up two frets.</p>

<p>However, starting on that same Dm chord and playing an Em chord on the top four strings is a more difficult transition. We need to change positions on the fretboard, and every finger in the chord needs to be moved.</p>

<hr />

<p>The family of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edit_distance">“edit distance” algorithms</a> tackles a similar problem. How difficult is it to transform one string into another, given a set of operations with fixed costs?</p>

<p>The Levenshtein distance algorithm is an example of an “edit distance” algorithm with three operations: insertion, deletion, and substitution. The Levenshtein distance between <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">kitten</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sitting</span></code> is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code>, where the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">k</span></code> is substituted for an <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">s</span></code>, and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">e</span></code> is substituted for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">i</span></code>, and the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">g</span></code> is inserted at the end of the word.</p>

<p>In the classic Levenshtein distance algorithm each of the three basic operations has a unit cost (a cost of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">1</span></code>). <a href="https://twitter.com/eugico/status/1029129770271993857">This doesn’t always have to be the case</a>. We can modify the algorithm to use our own set of operations, like “place finger”, “lift finger”, “move finger”, and “slide finger” to model how we transition from one chord to another. These operations might have a variable weight, depending on the operation and how far each finger has to move:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Placing and lifting a finger both seem similarly difficult. Let’s give both of these operations a constant unit cost.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Moving from the fifth fret, fifth string to the fifth fret, fourth string seems fairly simple, but moving from the fifth fret, fifth string to the second fret, third string would be more difficult. We’ll give the “move finger” operation a weight dependent on the distance we have to move.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Sliding a finger up or down a string seems to be special sub-case of the “move finger” operation. I would argue that sliding a finger from any fret to any other fret on a string is roughly the same difficult. We’ll give the “slide finger” operation a constant unit cost.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Let’s use this as a jumping off point for building our “fingering distance” calculator.</p>

<h2 id="calculating-fingering-distance">Calculating Fingering Distance</h2>

<p>Let’s start by defining a new module that will hold our new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Distance.Fingering do
  def distance(chord, chord),
    do: 0
end
</code></pre>

<p>Obviously, if we pass in two identical chords, the distance between them is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>.</p>

<p>A more interesting case occurs when we’re comparing a chord with one or more notes to an empty list. The total distance between these two “chords” is our “place finger” cost applied to each of the remaining notes in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(chord, []),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; length
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll need to handle the inverse case as well:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([], chord),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; length
</code></pre>

<p>The real meat of the algorithm comes into play when it’s time to determine the distance between two non-empty chords:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([note_a | rest_a] = chord_a, [note_b | rest_b] = chord_b),
  do:
    Enum.min([
      distance(rest_a, chord_b) + 1,
      distance(chord_a, rest_b) + 1,
      distance(rest_a, rest_b) + note_distance(note_a, note_b)
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>As you can see, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function is recursive. At every level of recursion, we calculate the distance required to transform <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_a</span></code> into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_b</span></code> by first:</p>

<ul>
  <li>Lifting a finger from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_a</span></code>.</li>
  <li>Lifting a finger from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_b</span></code>.</li>
  <li>Moving <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note_a</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note_b</span></code>.</li>
</ul>

<p>The initial choice with the lowest final cost is the choice we pick. Our decision ripples up through our stack until we’re left with the final, minimal cost of transitioning from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_a</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_b</span></code>.</p>

<p>Thank you, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Levenshtein">Dr. Levenshtein</a>!</p>

<h2 id="calculating-note-distance">Calculating Note Distance</h2>

<p>As we’ve seen, both placing and lifting a finger have constant unit costs. The real magic of our fingering distance algorithm happens in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note_distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function, where we calculating the cost of moving fingers between frets ands strings.</p>

        </form>
    </div>
</div>

<p>We’ll start with some trivial base cases. If the two notes we’re comparing are the same, the distance between them is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance(note, note),
  do: 0
</code></pre>

<p>If the first “note” is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>, we’re actually being asked for the cost of placing a finger:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance(nil, _),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if the second “note” is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>, we’re being asked how much it costs to lift a finger:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance(_, nil),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Now things are getting interesting. If we’re asked for the distance between two notes that live on the same string, we’ll report back the unit cost, as we discussed earlier:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance({_, _, string}, {_, _, string}),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>However, if the two notes live on different strings, we’ll treat out guitar’s fretboard like a grid, or city block, and return the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taxicab_geometry">“manhattan distance”</a> between the two notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def note_distance({fret_a, _, string_a}, {fret_b, _, string_b}),
  do: abs(fret_a - fret_b) + abs(string_a - string_b)
</code></pre>

<p>And that’s really all there is to it.</p>

<h2 id="a-few-examples">A Few Examples</h2>

<p>Going back to our previous examples, going from our Dm on the middle four string set to an Em on the same string should have a cost of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>. We’re just sliding each finger up two frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Distance.Fingering.distance(
  [nil, {5, 1}, {7, 3}, {7, 4}, {6, 2}, nil],
  [nil, {7, 1}, {9, 3}, {9, 4}, {8, 2}, nil]
)
</code></pre>

<p>And we do get <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>!</p>

<p>The cost of transitioning from that same Dm chord to an Em on the upper four string set should be higher than <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Distance.Fingering.distance(
  [nil, {5, 1}, {7, 3}, {7, 4}, {6, 2}, nil],
  [nil, nil, {2, 1}, {4, 3}, {5, 4}, {3, 2}]
)
</code></pre>

<p>And it is! We get a distance of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">6</span></code>.</p>

<h2 id="the-next-best-chord">The Next Best Chord</h2>

<p>And now for the grand finale. Let’s say we want to find the set of Cmaj7 voicings that have the best voice leading between our starting G7 chord. This is old hat from our previous articles:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[0, 4, 7, 11]
|&gt; Chord.voicings(4)
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;{Chord.Distance.Semitone.distance(&amp;1, [nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]), &amp;1})
|&gt; Enum.uniq()
|&gt; Enum.sort()
|&gt; Enum.chunk_by(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 0))
|&gt; List.first()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 1))
</code></pre>

<p>But now let’s take each of those voicings and find the best fingering for each with regards to how we’re fingering our G7 chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn chord -&gt;
  chord
  |&gt; Chord.fingerings()
  |&gt; Enum.uniq()
  |&gt; Enum.map(
    &amp;{Chord.Distance.Fingering.distance(&amp;1, [nil, {10, 1}, {12, 3}, {10, 1}, {12, 4}, nil]), &amp;1}
  )
  |&gt; Enum.sort()
  |&gt; Enum.map(&amp;elem(&amp;1, 1))
  |&gt; List.first()
end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we’ll take each fingered chord and render it to the console:</p>

<div>

  <p>Our final chords.</p>

<span class="date">August 26, 2018 11:00 PM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I don’t use any social media (apart from <a href="https://joinmastodon.org/">Mastodon</a>, which I briefly flirted with for a while earlier
this year before letting the accounts I’d made fall into disuse). I have many reasons, and the arguments against social media have been
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/media/2018/jan/23/never-get-high-on-your-own-supply-why-social-media-bosses-dont-use-social-media">done</a>
<a href="http://en.arguman.org/social-media-are-an-overall-benefit-to-society">to</a>
<a href="http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20180104-is-social-media-bad-for-you-the-evidence-and-the-unknowns">death</a>,
so I won’t bother restating them here - apart from one. I think it’s important to consider the effect social media - and other technologies! -
have on the amount of data we produce, and whether or not having all of this data around is a good thing.</p>

<p>If you do use social media, you likely produce quite a bit of data about yourself on a semi-regular basis. If you’re really eager, your profiles
may be an hourly blow-by-blow of your feelings, thoughts, and experiences; if you aren’t, your profile may be a little more relaxed and pensive.
The social media companies care about this data - after all, that’s why they’re giving you the social media service for free - but do you?
For most people, I’d wager that the utility of the data on their social media profile probably decreases as time goes on - what you thought
about your lunch today or yesterday may be interesting, especially if people are still replying to it, but you likely have zero interest
in what you had for lunch 50 days ago. Indeed, on today’s modern platforms, you’d probably have to do a fair amount of clicking through pages
of data in order to access the stuff you posted 50 years ago (again, this varies with posting frequency), so you likely don’t worry about it.
Nobody looks at that stuff, right?</p>

<p>Well, not quite right. Search engines, for example, are notorious for crawling through every word you’ve ever posted online and making it easily
accessible. Advertising and analytics companies analyse your posts, looking for clues that you might be interested in their brand new product
in order to serve you more relevant ads. Facebook itself occasionally sends you reminders about what you did a long time ago, in the interest
of injecting ‘blasts from the past’ into your timeline to make it somewhat more interesting.</p>

<p>The thing is, though, my original statement was partially right. No <em>human</em> looks at that stuff - this kind of data-trawling is a pretty new
activity that people have never really bothered or managed to do. If you weren’t someone who should have a place in the history books, most
minutiae about your life would be very quickly forgotten and lost, irreversibly, in the sands of time. After all,
nobody has a memory good enough to remember what you said two years ago today,
much less any caring for what happened then. As humans, we naturally forget about things that aren’t relevant - it’s part of keeping us sane,
after all. As the learning process of <a href="https://www.gwern.net/Spaced-repetition">spaced repetition</a> tries to combat, memory retention has a
natural <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Forgetting_curve">‘forgetting curve’</a> that prioritizes information we see more frequently, or information
that is relevant to us, whilst trashing the rest.</p>

<p>And, of course, sometimes things that might seem irrelevant to you might be stupendously relevant to someone else. If you manage to annoy someone
on the internet, they now have an unprecedented corpus of information with which to effect your downfall; there’s usually something you posted on
social media once in your life that you probably wouldn’t want to widely publicize, yet it’s now possible for angry blackmail-searchers to do just
that. This works excellently in conjunction with how hard it is to unambiguously convey tone on the internet - as
inimitable Rust contributor <em>brson</em> exemplifies in <a href="https://brson.github.io/2017/04/05/minimally-nice-maintainer">The Minimally-Nice Open Source Software Maintainer</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>It’s well understood that conveying tone on the internet is hard:</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>“Thanks.”</p>
  </blockquote>

  <p>What does that period mean? It looks so gruff. Are they pissed at me?! Are they having a bad day? On the internet the simple period can appear
sarcastic, or angry. It’s so neutral that people will project whatever emotions they want on it.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>Or you could take <a href="http://theoatmeal.com/pl/minor_differences/smiley">this example</a> from The Oatmeal, demonstrating how simple punctuation can
vastly change meaning:</p>

<p><img src="https://theta.eu.org/assets/img/with_smiley.jpg" alt="The Oatmeal comic" />
<img src="https://theta.eu.org/assets/img/without_smiley.jpg" alt="The Oatmeal comic" /></p>

<p>A more fundamental reason to worry about your data is the fact that your data is <em>yours</em>; it’s your property, so you should be able to do what
you like with it. If your social media posts were handwritten letters, how would you organize them? Would you throw them all in the bin
after a while, or would you keep the ones you liked and bin the rest? If a bunch of your letters were kept in a box in your friend Twitter’s house,
would you go and get them eventually? How long would you leave your stuff there? We don’t tend to treat digital data in this way - but sorting through
your digital life should probably occupy as much time as sorting through things in your physical life. If you’re the sort of person who bins
everything after they’re done with it, why not do that online as well? On the flipside, if you <em>do</em> like keeping mementos of the past for your
future self, why not spend some time doing that same curation process with your digital things?</p>

<p>I’ll leave you with some words from <a href="https://alexschroeder.ch/wiki/2017-04-27_Record_Keeping">this very similar blog post by Alex Schroeder</a>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>[…] We are built to forget the information that is not relevant. Forgetting is important.</p>

  <p>The alternative, the thing that we’re building right now, the default future if you will, is the exact opposite.
We’re building a panopticon where the rich and powerful can keep watch on us, where surveillance capitalism reaps the fruit of our data
and we can’t trust a single website. […]</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p><em>The Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</em> (SICP) is a classic computer science text written by Gerald Jay Sussman and Hal Abelson. It is widely known in the computer science community as the &#8220;wizard book&#8221;. It intends to teach the foundations of computer programming from &#8220;first principles&#8221;, illustrating programming language design using <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scheme_(programming_language)">Scheme</a>, a dialect of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lisp_(programming_language)">Lisp</a> language.</p>

</div>
<p>In this context, from Aug 26 &#8211; 31 2018, I am taking a <a href="https://hackernoon.com/taking-a-think-week-end-462fa4bb401e">&#8220;think week&#8221;</a> to reflect on my relationship to computer programming.</p>
<p>I am spending this week <a href="https://dabeaz.com/sicp.html">in Chicago with David Beazley</a> (<a href="https://twitter.com/dabeaz">@dabeaz</a>), where we will be spelunking through the land of this famed SICP textbook via <a href="https://racket-lang.org/">Racket</a>, a modern functional programming environment one can use to program in &#8212; and even extend &#8212; Scheme and many other languages.</p>
<p>The course will also (of course) involve some Python. This will be a fun follow-up to an earlier course I took with Beazley in 2011, <a href="https://www.dabeaz.com/compiler.html">&#8220;Write a Compiler (in Python)&#8221;</a>. I can&#8217;t believe I wrote the <a href="https://github.com/amontalenti/compiler">code for that course</a> over 7 years ago.</p>
<div align="center">
<img src="https://amontalenti.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/compilers.jpg" alt="" width="480" height="360" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2259" /><br />
<small>Back in 2011, I took &#8220;Write a Compiler (in Python)&#8221; with David Beazley. A handful of long-time professional programmers and Pythonistas, locked in a room together for 5 days, hacking away on a Python compiler for a Go-like language. It was so much fun. It proved to me that I loved programming! I&#8217;m the one whose head is exploding on the left.</small>
</div>
<h2>How I&#8217;m thinking about this course</h2>
<p>I have long identified primarily as a computer programmer. I studied Computer Science at NYU, and I currently read about programming languages, paradigms, and design patterns all the time. I have read way more technical programming books than any other category or genre of book.</p>
<p>But, I&#8217;m also someone who is interested in the business of software, and leadership of software teams, in a sort of secondary way to my love of software itself. Business books &#8212; and particularly books about high-growth startups and their teams &#8212; make up my other big obsession. But, in the last several months, I&#8217;ve seen my relationship with software change in a number of ways.</p>
<p><span id="more-2253"></span></p>
<p>First, as of April 2017, I have not written any &#8220;production&#8221; code for <a href="https://parse.ly">Parse.ly</a> systems. Last year, I wrote some code for an important production system (in C, no less!) right before starting the process for <a href="https://blog.parse.ly/post/6282/why-we-said-no-vc-money/">Parse.ly&#8217;s Series B financing round</a>. That round closed in August-September 2017. Once that was done, I spent the next several months running a hiring process for Parse.ly&#8217;s team, as well as kicking off several projects to extend our core products and to launch a brand new one.</p>
<p>All of these product initiatives had their major code and engineering contributions by the amazing Parse.ly product team, but I pulled myself completely out of all coding projects to focus exclusively on recruiting/hiring, mentorship, and product management.</p>
<p>This was the right move from the standpoint of Andy Grove&#8217;s concept of <a href="https://amzn.to/2BPhvPM">High Output Management</a>, that is, I was applying the concept of <a href="https://medium.com/@iantien/top-takeaways-from-andy-grove-s-high-output-management-2e0ecfb1ea63">&#8220;managerial leverage&#8221;</a>. With a team of 12 backend engineers, 5 frontend engineers, 5 support engineers, and several designers, I could do much more as a &#8220;force multiplier&#8221;, and even as a &#8220;project clarifier&#8221;, than I could do writing any single line of code.</p>
<p>But this transition was a struggle for me, personally. After all: it was the first time in ~15 years where my work no longer included directly writing and shipping code that makes products work. In other words, I was no longer in the <a href="https://amzn.to/2Nkv7np">practice of programming</a>. And, to reference Paul Graham, I had shifted <a href="http://www.paulgraham.com/makersschedule.html">from a maker&#8217;s schedule to a manager&#8217;s one</a>.</p>
<p>So, how does this all relate to functional programming, SICP, and my &#8220;think week&#8221;?</p>
<h2>Making coding a hobby again</h2>
<p>Well, I&#8217;m going to spend next week figuring out whether coding should continue to be my hobby.</p>
<p>It started as my hobby, and became my profession, and it&#8217;s now the technology lifeblood oozing through the company on which I spend my mental energy every day. But that company needs me much more as a technical leader and manager than it does need me as a coder.</p>
<p>I suspect coding <em>should</em> remain my hobby. And that I should write more (in English, and in code).</p>
<p>I suspect, <a href="http://amontalenti.com/2014/11/02/clojonic">similar to my explorations with Clojure a few years ago</a>, by looking at different ways of programming, it can help refresh my brain, but also help me re-establish my &#8220;hobbyist&#8221; relationship with programmer tasks.</p>
<p>It may not (ever again!) be wise for me to insert myself into complex and time-sensitive production coding projects at Parse.ly, but it may still make total sense for me to treat coding as one of my important &#8220;satisfying thought-work&#8221; activities, alongside writing and reading, which are the other two big ones for me.</p>
<p>If coding remains my hobby, I can establish a healthy relationship with it as a hobby. And that would be good for me and my own identity. Then I can shift my mind toward applying my coder brain toward challenges that truly change the way I think about automation and problems. Perhaps it can also change how I think about design of systems and of code.</p>
<p>Programming should be fun. It was when I started, and I still miss it. I&#8217;m hoping Beazley&#8217;s course is a little kick in the butt that I can make time for it as a hobby, once more.</p>
<p>This year, I began my professional transition to, &#8220;I am primarily a recruiter and leader of technical teams that operate on the <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2012/05/14/distributed-teams">fully distributed model</a> and that ship high-growth products with a huge business or societal impact.&#8221; But I still want to be <em>extremely</em> close to code &#8212; now, and for the rest of my life. I can focus on technical leadership at Parse.ly with little guilt &#8212; to know I have not thrown out my passion, and the thing that gives me my edge.</p>
<p>About 15 years ago, the open source community introduced me to Python, and it changed my life as a programmer forever. But, about 10 years ago, a sage programmer I deeply respected handed me the book <a href="https://amzn.to/2weksUQ">&#8220;The Anatomy of Lisp&#8221;</a>, and said that if I could read and understand <em>that</em> book, then I will have truly combined my computer science education with my practical programming experience, and be forever bettered for it. I tried to crack that book open over the years, but I never had the functional programming fundamentals to make it very far. Here&#8217;s to hoping that a guided path from Python to Racket to Scheme to SICP gets me one step closer to enlightenment.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I have just discovered &#8220;Experimental Psychology&#8221; by <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_S._Woodworth">Robert S. Woodworth</a>; first published in 1938, I have a reprinted in Great Britain copy from 1951.  The Internet Archive has a copy of the <a href="https://archive.org/details/in.ernet.dli.2015.125563">1954 revised edition</a>; it&#8217;s a very useful pdf, but it does not have the atmospheric musty smell of an old book.</p>
<p>The <a href="https://archive.org/search.php?query=%28woodworth%29%20AND%20title%3A%28Archives%20of%20Psychology%29">Archives of Psychology</a> was edited by Woodworth and contain reports of what look like ground breaking studies done in the 1930s.</p>
<p>The book is surprisingly modern, in that the topics covered are all of active interest today, in fields related to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cognitive_psychology">cognitive psychology</a>.  There are lots of experimental results (which always biases me towards really liking a book) and the coverage is extensive.</p>
<p>The history of cognitive psychology, as I understood it until this week, was early researchers asking questions, doing <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introspection">introspection</a> and sometimes running experiments in the late 1800s and early 1900s (e.g., <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilhelm_Wundt">Wundt</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermann_Ebbinghaus">Ebbinghaus</a>), <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Behaviorism">behaviorism</a> dominants the field, behaviorism is <a href="https://chomsky.info/1967____/">eviscerated by Chomsky</a> in the 1960s and cognitive psychology as we know it today takes off.</p>
<p>Now I know that lots of interesting and relevant experiments were being done in the 1920s and 1930s.</p>
<p>What is missing from this book?  The most obvious omission is equations; lots of data points plotted on graph paper, but no attempt to fit an equation to anything, e.g., an exponential curve to the rate of learning.</p>
<p>A more subtle omission is the world view; digital computers had not been invented yet and Shannon&#8217;s information theory was almost 20 years in the future.  Researchers tend to be heavily influenced by the tools they use and the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zeitgeist">zeitgeist</a>.  Computers as calculators and information processors could not be used as the basis for models of the human mind; they had not been invented yet.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Rust has been a daily part of my life for about 8 months now. I’ve had the distinct and somewhat surprising pleasure of getting to work with it professionally for Red Canary. It’s been a whole lot of fun.</p>
<p>Every so often, I learn something new about writing Rust. Most recently, that was over-use of <code>match</code> statements. In particular, my code base has a number of cases where I’m dealing with the <code>Result&lt;V, E&gt;</code> type. I need to decompose the <code>Result&lt;V, E&gt;</code> into its constituent <code>Ok(v)</code> and <code>Err(e)</code> variants in order to branch logic.</p>
<p>However, there are a number of places where I use a result type similar to: <code>Result&lt;(), SomeError&gt;</code>. This results in a bunch of code that looks like:</p>
<p><a id="poor_match_statement"></a></p>
<pre><code>let foo: Result&lt;(), SomeError&gt; = something_that_returns_result();
match foo {
    Ok(_) =&gt; {},
    Err(e) =&gt; println!(&quot;My error: {}&quot;, e.description())
}</code></pre>
<p>Initially, I didn’t think to hard about writing that. It was short enough and the intent was clear to me. After starting to use <code>cargo clippy</code> fastidiously on my code base, it kept pointing out ways to simplify the use of the inverse pattern above for the <code>Option&lt;T&gt;</code> type:</p>
<pre><code>let foo: Option&lt;String&gt; = something_that_returns_option();
match foo {
    Some(v) =&gt; do_a_thing_with_string(v),
    None =&gt; {}
}</code></pre>
<p><code>cargo clippy</code> kindly informed me that I should be using the <code>if let...</code> syntax instead of match for brevity:</p>
<pre><code>if let Some(foo) = something_that_returns_option() {
    do_a_thing_with_string(foo);
}</code></pre>
<p>After fixing a few of the <code>cargo clippy</code> lint issues <a href="https://blog.zacbrown.org/feed.rss#poor_match_statement">above</a>, I realized I could do the same thing with those functions I used which returned <code>Result&lt;(), SomeError&gt;</code>, just the inverse:</p>
<pre><code>if let Err(e) = something_that_returns_result() {
    println!(&quot;My error: {}&quot;, e.description();
}</code></pre>
<p>That’s clearer and simplifies the thinking in my opinion.</p>
<p><span class="small-caps">PS</span>: Maybe I should look at adding the inverse pattern to <code>cargo clippy</code> as a feature addition to that lint rule.</p></div>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I just found <a href="https://hackernoon.com/adding-a-pipe-operator-to-python-19a3aa295642">an article about pipes in Python</a> on lobste.rs and was reminded that I was toying with the exact same thing recently. Using a lot of functional languages (mainly Haskell, Clojure, Elixir)<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">… but being paid to write (mostly highly object-oriented) Python four out of five days a week. We do use some Elixir at my place, but we are still a Python shop first.<br />
<br />
</span></span> and also a fair bit of bash, I am very used to streaming data through chains of functions using pipe-like constructs. Python does make this quite difficult and encourages a more imperative approach with intermediate variables.</p>
<p>The author of the article above uses AST rewriting, which I have to admit is very clever, though hard to introspect and extend unless you are already familiar with AST manipulation in Python.</p>
<p>My approach is slightly different, and yields a less pretty syntax, but is arguably more flexible and extensible, by using a plain function. The definition currently looks like this:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="kw">def</span> pype(x, <span class="op">*</span>fs):
    <span class="co">&quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
<span class="co">    Pipe function. Takes an initial value and any number of functions/methods.</span>
<span class="co">    Methods as strings. Additional args are supported for functions &amp; methods</span>
<span class="co">    by suppling a step as a tuple/list with function/method as the first</span>
<span class="co">    element and the args as the rest. The pipe input is used as the last</span>
<span class="co">    argument in this case. Currently no kwargs.</span>
<span class="co">    &quot;&quot;&quot;</span>
    <span class="cf">while</span> fs:
        f <span class="op">=</span> fs[<span class="dv">0</span>]
        args <span class="op">=</span> []
        <span class="cf">if</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(f, (<span class="bu">list</span>, <span class="bu">tuple</span>)):
            args <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">list</span>(f[<span class="dv">1</span>:])
            f <span class="op">=</span> f[<span class="dv">0</span>]
        <span class="cf">if</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(f, <span class="bu">str</span>):
            <span class="cf">if</span> f.startswith(<span class="st">'.'</span>):
                x <span class="op">=</span> <span class="bu">getattr</span>(x, f[<span class="dv">1</span>:])(<span class="op">*</span>args)
            <span class="cf">else</span>:
                x <span class="op">=</span> x[f]
        <span class="cf">elif</span> <span class="bu">isinstance</span>(f, <span class="bu">int</span>):
            x <span class="op">=</span> x[f]
        <span class="cf">else</span>:
            x <span class="op">=</span> f(<span class="op">*</span>args <span class="op">+</span> [x])
        fs <span class="op">=</span> fs[<span class="dv">1</span>:]
    <span class="cf">return</span> x</code></pre></div>
<p>The docstring is a bit abstract, so I think an example is much more explanatory:</p>
<div class="sourceCode"><pre class="sourceCode python"><code class="sourceCode python"><span class="im">from</span> pype <span class="im">import</span> pype

<span class="kw">def</span> add_suffix(number, s):
    <span class="cf">return</span> <span class="st">'</span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st"> is </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st"> cool!'</span>.<span class="bu">format</span>(
        s,
        <span class="st">' '</span>.join(<span class="st">'very'</span> <span class="cf">for</span> _ <span class="kw">in</span> <span class="bu">range</span>(number))
    )

pype(
    <span class="st">'   abc: </span><span class="sc">{}</span><span class="st">   '</span>,
    <span class="st">'.strip'</span>,
    (<span class="st">'.format'</span>, <span class="dv">3</span>),
    (add_suffix, <span class="dv">2</span>),
    <span class="st">'.upper'</span>,
)

<span class="co"># 'ABC: 3 IS VERY VERY COOL!'</span></code></pre></div>
<p>I am aware this is a very constructed example, but you get the idea. It currently does not handle keyword arguments, and you cannot specify in which place you would like the input argument to go, it always takes the last slot, which isn’t always convenient, but this way you can avoid using <code>lambda</code>s everywhere, which are quite long in Python<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">I quite enjoy Elixir’s solution: <code>&amp;func(1, &amp;1, 3)</code>, <code>&amp;1</code> being the placeholder.<br />
<br />
</span></span>.</p>
<p>I might extend this further in the future and maybe introduce it into some code bases of mine, if it turns out to be useful.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://gkbrk.com/2018/08/mastodon-bot-in-common-lisp/">Mastodon Bot in Common Lisp</a>

<span class="date">August 20, 2018 10:20 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>If you post a programming article to Hacker News, Reddit or Lobsters; you will
notice that soon after it gets to the front page, it gets posted to Twitter
automatically.</p>

<p>But why settle for Twitter when you can have this on Mastodon? In this article
we will write Mastodon bot that regularly checks the
<a href="https://lobste.rs/">Lobste.rs</a> front page and posts new links to Mastodon.</p>

<p>Since this is a Mastodon bot, let&rsquo;s start by sending a post to our followers.</p>

<h2>Sending a Mastodon post</h2>

<p>To interact with Mastodon, we are going to use a library called <em>Tooter</em>. To get
the API keys you need; just log in to Mastodon, go to <em>Settings &gt; Development &gt;
New Application</em>. Once you create an application, the page will show all the API
keys you need.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>get-mastodon-client</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>(</span><span>make-instance</span> <span>'tooter:client</span>
                 <span>:base</span> <span>"https://botsin.space"</span>
                 <span>:name</span> <span>"lobsterbot"</span>
                 <span>:key</span> <span>"Your client key"</span>
                 <span>:secret</span> <span>"Your client secret"</span>
                 <span>:access-token</span> <span>"Your access token"</span><span>)</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This function will create a Mastodon client whenever you call it. Now, let&rsquo;s
send our first message.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>tooter:make-status</span> <span>(</span><span>get-mastodon-client</span><span>)</span> <span>"Hello world!"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now that we can send messages, the next step in our project is to fetch the RSS
feed.</p>

<h2>Fetching the RSS feed</h2>

<p>Fetching resources over HTTP is really straightforward with Common Lisp, the
<em>drakma</em> library provides an easy-to-use function called <em>http-request</em>.  In
order to get the contents of my blog, all you need to do is</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>drakma:http-request</span> <span>"https://gkbrk.com"</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>So let&rsquo;s write a function that takes a feed URL and returns the RSS items.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>There is one case we need to handle with this. When you are fetching
<code>text/html</code>, <em>drakma</em> handles the decoding for you; but it doesn&rsquo;t do this when
we fetch <code>application/rss</code>. Instead, it returns a byte array.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defvar</span> <span>feed-path</span> <span>"https://lobste.rs/rss"</span><span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>get-rss-feed</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>"Gets rss feed of Lobste.rs"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let*</span> <span>((</span><span>xml-text</span> <span>(</span><span>babel:octets-to-string</span> <span>(</span><span>drakma:http-request</span> <span>feed-path</span><span>)))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>xml-tree</span> <span>(</span><span>plump:parse</span> <span>xml-text</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>plump:get-elements-by-tag-name</span> <span>xml-tree</span> <span>"item"</span><span>)</span>
    <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This function fetches an RSS feed, parses the XML and returns the <code>&lt;item&gt;</code> tags
in it. In our case, these tags contain each post <em>Lobste.rs</em>.</p>

<h2>Creating structs for the links</h2>

<p>A struct in Common Lisp is similar to a struct in C and other languages. It is
one object that stores multiple fields.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defstruct</span> <span>lobsters-post</span>
  <span>title</span>
  <span>url</span>
  <span>guid</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Getting and setting fields of a struct can be done like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>; Pretend that we have a post called p</span>
<span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-title</span> <span>p</span><span>)</span> <span>"An interesting article"</span><span>)</span> <span>; Set the title</span>
<span>(</span><span>print</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-title</span> <span>p</span><span>))</span>                         <span>; Print the title</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s map the RSS tags to our struct fields.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>find-first-element</span> <span>(</span><span>tag</span> <span>node</span><span>)</span>
  <span>"Search the XML node for the given tag name and return the text of the first one"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>plump:render-text</span> <span>(</span><span>car</span> <span>(</span><span>plump:get-elements-by-tag-name</span> <span>node</span> <span>tag</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>parse-rss-item</span> <span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
  <span>"Parse an RSS item into a lobsters-post"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let</span> <span>((</span><span>post</span> <span>(</span><span>make-lobsters-post</span><span>)))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-title</span> <span>post</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>find-first-element</span> <span>"title"</span> <span>item</span><span>))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-url</span> <span>post</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>find-first-element</span> <span>"link"</span> <span>item</span><span>))</span>
    <span>(</span><span>setf</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-guid</span> <span>post</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>find-first-element</span> <span>"guid"</span> <span>item</span><span>))</span>
    <span>post</span>
    <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now, we can make the previous <em>get-rss-feed</em> function return <em>lobsters-post</em>&lsquo;s
instead of raw XML nodes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>get-rss-feed</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>"Gets rss feed of Lobste.rs"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let*</span> <span>((</span><span>xml-text</span> <span>(</span><span>babel:octets-to-string</span> <span>(</span><span>drakma:http-request</span> <span>*feed-url*</span><span>)))</span>
         <span>; Tell the parser that we want XML tags instead of HTML</span>
         <span>; This is needed because &lt;link&gt; is a self-closing tag in HTML</span>
         <span>(</span><span>plump:*tag-dispatchers*</span> <span>plump:*xml-tags*</span><span>)</span>
         <span>(</span><span>xml-tree</span> <span>(</span><span>plump:parse</span> <span>xml-text</span><span>))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>items</span> <span>(</span><span>plump:get-elements-by-tag-name</span> <span>xml-tree</span> <span>"item"</span><span>))</span>
         <span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>reverse</span> <span>(</span><span>map</span> <span>'list</span> <span>#'</span><span>parse-rss-item</span> <span>items</span><span>))</span>
    <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Posting the first link to Mastodon</h2>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>share-post</span> <span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
  <span>"Takes a lobsters-post and posts it on Mastodon"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>tooter:make-status</span> <span>(</span><span>get-mastodon-client</span><span>)</span> <span>(</span><span>format</span> <span>nil</span> <span>"~a - ~a ~a"</span>
                                                    <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-title</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span>
                                                    <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-guid</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span>
                                                    <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-url</span> <span>item</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>)</span>

<span>(</span><span>share-post</span> <span>(</span><span>car</span> <span>(</span><span>get-rss-feed</span><span>)))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Keeping track of shared posts</h2>

<p>We don&rsquo;t want our bot to keep posting the same links. One solution to this is to
keep all the links we already posted in a file called <em>links.txt</em>.</p>

<p>Every time we come accross a link, we will record it to our <em>&ldquo;database&rdquo;</em>. This
basically appends the link follewed by a newline to the file. Not very fancy,
but certainly enough for our purposes.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>record-link-seen</span> <span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
  <span>"Writes a link to the links file to keep track of it"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>with-open-file</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>"links.txt"</span>
                          <span>:direction</span> <span>:output</span>
                          <span>:if-exists</span> <span>:append</span>
                          <span>:if-does-not-exist</span> <span>:create</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>format</span> <span>stream</span> <span>"~a~%"</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-guid</span> <span>item</span><span>)))</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>In order to filter our links before posting, we will go through each line in
that file and check if our link is in there.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>is-link-seen</span> <span>(</span><span>item</span><span>)</span>
  <span>"Returns if we have processed a link before"</span>
  <span>(</span><span>with-open-file</span> <span>(</span><span>stream</span> <span>"links.txt"</span>
                          <span>:if-does-not-exist</span> <span>:create</span><span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>loop</span> <span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>read-line</span> <span>stream</span> <span>nil</span><span>)</span>
       <span>while</span> <span>line</span>
       <span>when</span> <span>(</span><span>string=</span> <span>line</span> <span>(</span><span>lobsters-post-guid</span> <span>item</span><span>))</span> <span>return</span> <span>t</span><span>))</span>
  <span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Now let&rsquo;s wrap this all up by creating a task that</p>

<ul>
<li>Fetches the RSS feed</li>
<li>Gets the top 10 posts</li>
<li>Filters out the links that we shared before</li>
<li>Posts them to Mastodon</li>
</ul>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight common_lisp"><code><span>(</span><span>defun</span> <span>run-mastodon-bot</span> <span>()</span>
  <span>(</span><span>let*</span> <span>((</span><span>first-ten</span> <span>(</span><span>subseq</span> <span>(</span><span>get-rss-feed</span><span>)</span> <span>0</span> <span>10</span><span>))</span>
         <span>(</span><span>new-links</span> <span>(</span><span>remove-if</span> <span>#'</span><span>is-link-seen</span> <span>first-ten</span><span>))</span>
         <span>)</span>
    <span>(</span><span>loop</span> <span>for</span> <span>item</span> <span>in</span> <span>new-links</span> <span>do</span>
         <span>(</span><span>share-post</span> <span>item</span><span>)</span>
         <span>(</span><span>record-link-seen</span> <span>item</span><span>))</span>
    <span>))</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>How you schedule this to run regularly is up to you. Set up a cron job, make a
timer or just run it manually all the time.</p>

<p>I’ve always had a tumultuous relationship with caffeine. When I was younger I would drink gallons of diet soda a day (sometimes literally). As I grew older I discovered coffee and increased my caffeine consumption by orders of magnitude.</p>

<p>It took me until I was nearly thirty years old to realize that my consumption of huge amounts of caffeine was probably related to a low-level background radiation of anxiety that I’d been experiencing nearly my entire life. In an effort to better myself, I tried cutting back on coffee and even quitting altogether. I always found it difficult to restrict myself to one or even two cups a day, and quitting was always unsuccessful for one reason or another.</p>

<p>At that point, I decided that my current relationship with coffee was unhealthy, so I decided to try switching to tea. I quickly went whole hog into the tea world. I bought myself <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaiwan">a gaiwan</a>, and started buying tea from amazing import companies like <a href="https://what-cha.com/">What-Cha</a> and <a href="http://white2tea.com/about/">white2tea</a>.</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/coffee-tea-and-theanine/tea.png" />
  <p>Tea in a gaiwan.</p>
</div>

<p>I loved it! What’s more, <em>I felt better.</em> My anxiety lessened, I felt less dependent on it every morning, and I didn’t feel like I was chasing the daily “buzz” like I would with coffee.</p>

<p>Recently I started drinking more <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pu%27er_tea">pu-erh teas</a>, which are a style of tea where the leaves are fermented before being pressed into cakes. As I started to drink pu-erh more consistently, I began to notice my anxiety levels begin to ramp up. Once again, I found myself having cup after cup, trying to catch a caffeine buzz. Something was different. I decided to look into the differences between pu-erh and other types of teas.</p>

<p>I came across <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4787341/">this 2016 study</a> carried out by the Department of Pharmacognosy, University of Szeged, Hungary, who’s goal was to compare the correlations of caffeine and tea contents between a variety of tea processing techniques.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>Caffeine and L-theanine are pharmacologically important constituents of tea, especially due to their effects on the central nervous system. The effects of these two compounds are opposite: While caffeine is a well-known stimulant, theanine has a relaxing effect. Tea processing may influence the caffeine and theanine content of tea leaves.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>While a sampled set of white, green, oolong, black, and pu-erh teas all contained similar levels of caffeine, the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theanine">L-theanine</a> content in the pu-erh samples tested were <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4787341/#ui-ncbiinpagenav-heading-8">“practically zero.”</a></p>

<blockquote>
  <p>The average theanine concentration of oolong samples was 6.09 mg/g with a mean caffeine level of 19.31 mg/g (caffeine/theanine ratio 4.20). In the pu-erh tea, no theanine was detected.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>So maybe it’s not a reduction in caffeine that’s improving my quality of life. Maybe it’s the introduction of theanine. Either way, I’ve decided to drop the pu-erh for now and go back to drinking oolongs.</p>

<p>It’s said that programmers “turn caffeine into code.” How’s your relationship with coffee, tea, and caffeine, and how does it affect your life and career?</p></div>

<span class="date">August 19, 2018 08:17 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A recent <a href="https://www.allankellyassociates.co.uk/archives/2238/estimation-planning-teams-and-money-some-data/">blog post by Allan Kelly</a> caught my attention;  on Monday Allan sent me some comments on the <a href="http://www.knosof.co.uk/ESEUR">draft of my book</a> and I got to ask for a copy of his data (you don&#8217;t need your own software engineering data before sending me comments).</p>
<p>During an Agile training course he gives, Allan runs an exercise based on an extended version of the <a href="http://www.agilebelgium.be/xpgame/">XP game</a>.  The basic points are: people form into teams, a task is announced, teams have to estimate how long it will take them to complete the task and then to plan the task implementation.  Allan recorded information on team size, time spent estimating and time spent planning (no information on the tasks, which were straightforward, e.g., fold a paper airplane).</p>
<p>In a recent post I gave a brief <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2018/08/11/maximum-team-size-before-progress-begins-to-stall/">analysis of team size on productivity</a>.  What does this XP game data have to say about the impact of team size on performance?</p>
<p>We don&#8217;t have task information, but we do have two timing measurements for each team.  With a bit of suck-it-and-see analysis, I found that the following equation explained 50% of the variance (<a href="http://www.coding-guidelines.com/code-data/XP-game.tgz">code+data</a>):</p>
<p><img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_1a82ab82be64c7c73af3610ba5984c3b.png" alt="Planning=-4+0.8*TeamSize+5*sqrt{Estimate}" title="Planning=-4+0.8*TeamSize+5*sqrt{Estimate}" /></p>
<p>where: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_bd53afc9840da53b8ff974091c455956.png" alt="TeamSize" title="TeamSize" /> is the number of people on a team, <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_6ecfea349da2aff209e7fad8afe752c2.png" alt="Estimate" title="Estimate" /> is the time in minutes the team spent estimating and <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_452fc79962543ec9a7b983436a517933.png" alt="Planning" title="Planning" /> is time in minutes the team spent planning the task implementation.</p>
<p>There was some flexibility in the numbers, depending on the method used to build the regression model.</p>
<p>The introduction of each new team member incurs a fixed overhead.  Given that everybody is sitting together around a table, this is not surprising; or, perhaps the problem was so simply that nobody felt the need to give a personal response to everything said by everybody else; or, perhaps the exercise was run just before lunch and people were hungry.</p>
<p>I am not aware of any connection between time spent estimating and time spent planning, but then I know almost nothing about this kind of XP game exercise.  That square-root looks interesting (an exponent of 0.4 or 0.6 was a slightly less good fit).  Thoughts and experiences anybody?</p>
<p><ins datetime="2018-08-19T21:35:35+00:00">Update:</ins>  I forgot to mention that including the <em>date</em> of the workshop in the above model increases the variance explained to 90%.  The date here is a proxy for the task being solved.  A model that uses just the <em>date</em> explains 75% of the variance.</p></div>

<p>From <a href="http://amzn.to/2gJ3cRZ">Good Business</a>, by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi, the author of <a href="http://amzn.to/2gLxmCn">Flow</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Another condition that makes work more flowlike is <em>the opportunity to concentrate</em>. In many jobs, constant interruptions build up to a state of chronic emergency and distraction.
</p></blockquote>
<p>He goes on:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  Stress is not so much the product of hard work, as it is of having to switch attention to from one task to the other without having any control over the process.
</p></blockquote>
<div align="center">

</div>
<p><span id="more-2233"></span></p>
<p>This is why engineers glare at you during interruptions:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  If a person who is working on a problem for hours is interrupted by a phone call, it may take another half hour afterward to get her mind back to the point where it was before the call.
</p></blockquote>
<p>And, this is why that&#8217;s not so crazy:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  When person A comes by to discuss his problems, you have to re-organize your mind to see things from his point of view.
</p></blockquote>
<p>Finally, this is how a single incident can spiral into an &#8220;interruption culture&#8221;:</p>
<blockquote><p>
  But when B, C, and D stop in one after the other with their issues, and each requires that you clear your mind of the previous set and refurnish it with the elements of new personalities, and their specific problems, that can take a toll on consciousness quite quickly. After a few hours, your brain feels like a quivering mass of jelly.
</p></blockquote>
<p>We need to be careful about this on <a href="https://amontalenti.com/2012/05/14/distributed-teams">fully distributed teams</a>, too. That&#8217;s because with tools like Slack, we are actually quickly careening back toward the interruption culture of co-located offices of the 90&#8217;s and early 00&#8217;s.</p>

<h4><a href="http://www.wezm.net/technical/2018/08/anatomy-of-a-great-rust-blog/">Anatomy of a Great Rust Blog</a>

<span class="date">August 18, 2018 06:17 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>To date I've posted 718 posts to <a href="https://readrust.net/">Read Rust</a>. I can't profess to having read
every single one completely (although I have read a lot of them) but I have at
least skimmed them all and extracted the information required to post them to
the site. Some blogs make this easier than others. In this post I cover some
things you can do to make your blog, and the posts upon it, easier for readers
and myself alike, to read and share with as many people as possible.</p>

<p>I'll cover four areas:</p>

<ol>
<li>Tell a Story</li>
<li>Sign Your Work</li>
<li>Make It Easy to Read Future Posts</li>
<li>Provide Metadata</li>
</ol>


<h2><img src="http://www.wezm.net/images/2018/noun_Book_1561008.svg" class="heading-icon" alt="" /> Tell a Story</h2>


<p>A story has a beginning, middle, and end. Blog posts benefit from this
structure too. The beginning sets the scene, and provides a shared starting
point for the main content of your post. When a post just dives straight into
the details without context it can be hard to follow the topic,
the background, and the motivations behind the work.</p>

<p>Once you've set the scene in your introduction, you can dig into the details
knowing your readers are on the same page, and more likely to follow along. This
is where the bulk of your post is written.</p>

<p>At the end of your post wrap up with a conclusion. This may include a
summary, details of future work, or unsolved problems.</p>

<h2><img src="http://www.wezm.net/images/2018/noun_write_1560855.svg" class="heading-icon" alt="" /> Sign Your Work</h2>


<p>Writing a post takes time and effort. You can be proud of that and sign your
work! I'm aware that some people prefer not to use their real names online. A
pseudonym, or handle, work well too. When posting to Read Rust it's important to
me to attribute the article to the original author. When there is no
information on a post it's hard to work out how to credit the post.</p>

<h2><img src="http://www.wezm.net/images/2018/noun_Transmitter_1560979.svg" class="heading-icon" alt="" /> Make It Easy to Read Future Posts</h2>


<p>If you've written an interesting post that readers have enjoyed, often they
will want to read future posts that you write. You can make this easy using an
RSS feed. Pretty much all blogging software supports RSS. If you aren't already
generating a feed I highly recommended adding one.</p>

<p>If you already have an RSS feed on your blog ensure it's easily discoverable by
linking it. Perhaps in the header, footer, sidebar, or about page. Additionally
include a <code>&lt;link rel="alternate"&gt;</code> tag in the <code>&lt;head&gt;</code> of your HTML to make the
feed automatically discoverable by feed readers. MDN have a great tutorial series
about RSS covering these details: <a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/RSS/Getting_Started">Syndicating content with RSS</a>.</p>

<p>When looking for posts for Read Rust it would be impractical for me to manually
visit the websites of every interesting blog to see if there are new posts.
RSS lets me subscribe to blogs in my feed reader of choice (<a href="http://feedbin.com/">Feedbin</a>),
allowing me and other readers to discover, and read your new posts all in one
place.</p>

<h2><img src="http://www.wezm.net/images/2018/noun_Tag_1560911.svg" class="heading-icon" alt="" /> Provide Metadata</h2>


<p>There are actually two audiences for your content: humans and machines.  The
humans are the readers, the machines are computers such as <a href="https://duckduckgo.com/">search engine
indexers</a>, <a href="https://web.archive.org/">web archivers</a>, and the Read Rust tools! Ideally your
content should be easy for both to read.</p>

<p>The <a href="https://github.com/wezm/read-rust/blob/d41672caaa269fc7f4584e5db2154bd9b3bd3c92/src/bin/add-url.rs">add-url tool in the Read Rust codebase</a> looks for a number
of pieces of metadata in order to fill in the details that are included
in the entry for every post:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Title</strong> in a <code>&lt;title&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li><strong>Author Name</strong> in a <code>&lt;meta name="author" …&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li><strong>Author URL</strong> in a <code>&lt;link rel="author" …&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li><strong>Date Published</strong> in a <code>&lt;time&gt;</code> tag, typically nested within an <code>&lt;article&gt;</code> tag.</li>
<li><strong>Post Summary</strong> (excerpt) in a <code>&lt;meta name="description" …&gt;</code> tag.</li>
</ul>


<p>The tool looks for these in the post itself, as well as in the RSS
feed if found. Often it still turns up empty. You can help your
content be more machine readable by including this metadata in your
HTML. The example below shows all of these properties in use.</p>

<pre><code class="language-html">&lt;!DOCTYPE html&gt;
&lt;html&gt;
&lt;head&gt;
  &lt;meta charset="utf-8" /&gt;
  &lt;meta name="viewport" content="initial-scale=1.0" /&gt;
  &lt;title&gt;Post Title&lt;/title&gt;
  &lt;meta name="description" content="The design and operation of the little Rust content aggregator I built."&gt;
  &lt;meta name="author" content="Wesley Moore"&gt;
  &lt;link rel="alternate" href="http://www.wezm.net/feed/" type="application/atom+xml" title="WezM.net - All Articles" /&gt;
  &lt;link rel="author" href="http://www.wezm.net/" /&gt;
&lt;/head&gt;
&lt;body&gt;
  &lt;!-- header, nav, etc. --&gt;

  &lt;main&gt;
    &lt;article&gt;
      &lt;h1&gt;Post Title&lt;/h1&gt;
      &lt;time datetime="2018-06-03T07:34"&gt;03 June 2018&lt;/time&gt;

      &lt;!-- post content --&gt;
    &lt;/article&gt;
  &lt;/main&gt;

  &lt;!-- footer, etc. --&gt;
&lt;/body&gt;
&lt;/html&gt;
</code></pre>

<p>So that's it. Four things you can do to help make your blog more readable,
attributable, and discoverable. Your readers, human and machine will thank you.</p>

<p>This is the incredibly weird chain of bugs and hardware issues that bricked my iPhone after the battery of my Apple Watch started to swell.</p>

<p>A couple of months ago the battery of my 1st gen Apple Watch started to swell and the screen popped out. I googled about this issue and read that it's covered by a warranty program, so I brought the watch to the Apple Store in Barcelona. The watch got serviced in a few days, excellent customer support as usual by Apple. </p>

<p>I got home and tried to link this new watch to my iPhone 5s. For some reason the watch refused to link unless I upgraded iOS 10 to iOS 11 on my phone. </p>

<p>My old watch had been working perfectly with iOS 10, but apparently this refurbished one had a new software version that required iOS 11 to work.</p>

<p>I had kept my phone at iOS 10 because my 5s is a bit slow nowadays, I don't need the new features, and in general prefer stability on my main devices. I think, it can't be that bad, and furthermore I had missed my watch so much these last days, so I decide to upgrade.</p>

<p>Terrible decision.</p>

<p>I tap on "Upgrade". The phone downloads the upgrade, starts installing it, progress bar, reboot, progress bar, reboot... one too many times. It's stuck on a reboot look around 80% of progress. Ok, two options, I think. Hardware issue or software issue. How could it be hardware? The phone was working well up to ten minutes ago. So I decide to install clean, wiping out all my data</p>

<p>It's now late afternoon and next day I have to work, and need the phone. You know that feeling, right? This won't end well. I do a clean install, set up Whatsapp and Google Maps, hoping to restore from an icloud backup next day while at work.</p>

<p>The clean install lets me reach the iOS 11 setup screen. Set up wifi, tap next, and reboot. Damn. Set up wifi again, reboot. This doesn't look like a software issue. I try something... I wait five minutes on the wifi setup screen without touching anything. Surprisingly, the phone does not reboot.</p>

<p>I set up wifi after these five minutes and the phone reboots instantly. Any electrical engineer (or probably most of you here that's read about batteries and iOS 11) knows what's happening by now. The battery is failing to supply enough voltage, and this is made apparent at peak power demand, that is, when antennas are working and CPU is at max. I resign myself to having no phone for the next day.</p>

<p>Then, I realize I have a spare iPhone 5s battery laying around, One that I bought to replace my mother's battery (she has also an iPhone 5s) but never ended up fixing. I've changed batteries maybe a dozen times before, and work with electronics regularly. I know best practices. I ground myself, pick up the screwdrivers and suction cup, open up the iPhone carefully, remove the battery glue strips, and install the new battery.</p>

<p>The phone boots.</p>

<p>With the new battery I finally manage to get past the wifi screen but unfortunately the phone keeps rebooting randomly when accessing networks. Damn. My phone clearly has an electrical problem and for whatever reason iOS 11 triggered it. Later, when discussing this issue when a Genius, they confirmed that this is a motherboard problem which required an expensive repair.</p>

<p>Back to the 5S. Since I couldn't use a phone that dies on me randomly, and it's late at night, I picked up my old 4S, popped in my SIM, quickly downloaded Whatsapp and Maps, set up my work email and a few more apps, hoping all icloud data syncs over night. Fortunately, it did.</p>

<p>The next day I started using the 4S as my daily driver. I managed to stick with it for a month, but in the end, it was too slow for everyday usage. It was nice as an experiment, but a pain in the neck to work with.</p>

<p>That's the end more or less. I have a new Apple Watch that killed my 5S, which ironically I couldn't use because my replacement 4S wasn't compatible with that Watch.</p>

<p>I still don't know why iOS 11 draws more power than iOS 10, or if it was a firmware change that really killed my phone. But my bet is on battery management. Doesn't matter now. It was a disaster.</p>

<p>As I was saying, I ended up buying an SE, which is two years old, at full retail price. Well, I got a 40€ discount by trading in the broken 5S. </p>

<p>The <em>cheapest iPhone</em> is not a great deal nowadays, but it still is the perfect phone for my usage/size/budget.</p>

<p>It is not my intention to blame Apple. I fully understand what happened, and it was a chain of unfortunate events. However, I have the feeling that if I could have downgraded the 5S to iOS 10, it may have come back from the dead. </p>

<span class="date">August 16, 2018 08:40 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>This week my Pi stopped working. After hooking up a monitor I saw kernel errors related to VFS. So the file system was obviously broken. Oops.</p>
<p>The end conclusion is that the SD card is physically &#8216;broken&#8217;, but I still managed to salvage my data — which is more important than the card. Here&#8217;s how.</p>
<h3><strong>Broken file system: fsck or dd?</strong></h3>
<p>What didn&#8217;t work for me, but you might want to give a try first are <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fsck"><strong>fsck</strong></a> for file system consistency check or using <a href="https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dd_(Unix)"><strong>dd</strong></a> to create a disk image.</p>
<p>I couldn&#8217;t check/repair the file system with fsck (it gave errors), not even when setting different superblocks. It might work for you, so you can give <a href="https://www.cyberciti.biz/faq/recover-bad-superblock-from-corrupted-partition/">this blog a try</a>.</p>
<p>Next, I tried to &#8216;clone&#8217; the bits on the file system with <strong>dd</strong>. To get a usable image. But that didn&#8217;t work either, spewing out errors. But this is where I stumbled across <a href="https://www.gnu.org/software/ddrescue/"><strong>ddrescue.</strong></a></p>
<h3><strong>GNU ddrescue</strong></h3>
<p>I had not heard of ddrescue before but it turned out to be a <del>life</del> datasaver! It does what dd does, but in the process tries &#8220;to rescue the good parts first in case of read errors&#8221;. There are <a href="https://askubuntu.com/questions/211578/whats-the-difference-between-ddrescue-gddrescue-and-dd-rescue/211579#211579">two versions of this program</a>, I used the GNU version.</p>
<p><code>sudo apt-get install gddrescue</code></p>
<p>And here is what a sigh of relief looks like, after 43 minutes:<a href="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ddrescue.jpeg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2121" src="https://j11g.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/08/ddrescue.jpeg" alt="" width="3762" height="661" /></a></p>
<p>So the command is:</p>
<p><code>ddrescue -f -n /dev/[baddrive] /root/[imagefilename].img /tmp/recovery.log</code></p>
<p>The options I used came <a href="https://datarecovery.com/rd/how-to-clone-hard-disks-with-ddrescue/">from this blog</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li>-f Force ddrescue to run even if the destination file already exists (this is required when writing to a disk). It will overwrite.</li>
<li>-n Short for’–no-scrape’. This option prevents ddrescue from running through the scraping phase, essentially preventing the utility from spending too much time attempting to recreate heavily damaged areas of a file.</li>
</ul>
<p>After you have an image you can mount it and browse your data:</p>
<p><code>mount -o loop rescue.img /mnt/rescue</code></p>
<p>With this I had access to my data! So I got a new SD card copied my data over and chucked the old SD card. And remember:</p>

Visibility into performance bottlenecks was the driving force behind the design of Wallaroo&rsquo;s Monitoring Hub and Metrics UI. We wanted to provide tooling for users to be able to observe their application as it performed in real-time and provide enough introspection for them to make adjustments to their applications based on what they were seeing; whether that was adding additional workers to distribute a high workload or rewriting a computation to be more efficient.</div>

<p>BSI have downsized us, they no longer provide a committee secretary to take minutes and provide a point of contact.  Somebody from a service pool responds (or not) to emails.  I did not blink first to our chair&#8217;s request for somebody to take the minutes <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":-)" class="wp-smiley" /></p>
<p>What interesting things came up?</p>
<p>It transpires that <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2017/07/12/2017-in-the-programming-language-standards-world/">reports of the death of Cobol standards work</a> may be premature.  There are a few people working on &#8216;new&#8217; features, e.g., support for JSON.  This work is happening at the ISO level, rather than the national level in the US (where the real work on the Cobol standard used to be done, before being handed on to the ISO).  Is this just a couple of people pushing a few pet ideas or will it turn into something more substantial?  We will have to wait and see.</p>
<p>The Unicode consortium (a vendor consortium) are <a href="https://www.buzzfeednews.com/article/charliewarzel/inside-the-great-poop-emoji-feud">continuing to propose</a> new <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pile_of_Poo_emoji">pile of poo emoji</a> and <a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG20/">WG20</a> (an ISO committee) were doing what they can to stay sane.</p>
<p>Work on the <a href="https://isotc.iso.org/livelink/livelink/open/jtc1SC22wg17">Prolog standard</a>, now seems to be concentrated in Austria.  <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prolog">Prolog</a> was the language to be associated with, if you were on the 1980s AI bandwagon (and the Japanese were going to take over the world unless we did something about it, e.g., spend money); this time around, it&#8217;s machine learning.  With one <a href="http://www.swi-prolog.org/">dominant open source implementation</a> and <a href="https://quintus.sics.se/">one commercial vendor</a> (cannot think of any others), standards work is a relic of past glories.</p>
<p>In pre-internet times there was an incentive to kill off committees that were past their sell-by date; it cost money to send out mailings and document storage occupied shelf space.  In an electronic world there is no incentive to spend time killing off such committees, might as well wait until those involved retire or die.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.open-std.org/JTC1/SC22/WG23/">WG23</a> (programming language vulnerabilities) reported <a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=site%3Aopen-std.org%2Fjtc1%2Fsc22%2Fwg21%2F+sg12">lots of interest in their work</a> from people involved in the C++ standard, and for some reason the C++ committee people in the room started glancing at me.  I was a good boy, and did not mention <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2016/07/27/is-the-iso-c-standards-committee-past-its-sell-by-date/">bored consultants</a>.</p>
<p>It looks like <a href="http://www.iso.org/iso/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=43781">ISO/IEC 23360-1:2006</a>, the ISO version of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linux_Standard_Base">Linux Base Standard</a> is going to be updated to reflect LBS 5.0; something that was <a href="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/2015/08/18/2015-in-the-programming-language-standards-world/">not certain few years ago</a>.</p></div>

<h4><a href="http://benaiah.me/posts/configuring-go-apps-with-toml">Configuring Go Apps with TOML</a>

<span class="date">August 14, 2018 02:17 PM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<h1>Configuring Go Apps with TOML</h1>
<p>So you’ve been writing an application in Go, and you’re getting to the
point where you have a lot of different options in your program.
You’ll likely want a configuration file, as specifying every option on
the command-line can get difficult and clunky, and launching
applications from a desktop environment makes specifying options at
launch even more difficult.</p>
<p>This post will cover configuring Go apps using a simple, INI-like
configuration language called <a href="https://github.com/toml-lang/toml">TOML</a>, as well as some related
difficulties and pitfalls.</p>
<p>TOML has quite a few implementations, including several libraries for
Go. I particularly like
<a href="https://github.com/burntsushi/toml">BurntSushi’s TOML parser and decoder</a>, as it lets
you marshal a TOML file directly into a struct. This means your
configuration can be fully typed and you can easily do custom
conversions (such as parsing a <code>time.Duration</code>) as you read the
config, so you don’t have to do them in the rest of your application.</p>
<h2>Configuration location</h2>
<p>The first question you should ask when adding config files to any app
is "where should they go?". For tools that aren’t designed to be run
as a service, as root, or under a custom user (in other words, most of
them), you should be putting them in the user’s home directory, so
they’re easily changed. A few notes:</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Even if you currently have only one file, you should use a folder
and put the config file within it. That way, if and when you do need
other files there, you won’t have to clutter the user’s home
directory or deal with loading config files that could be in two
different locations (Emacs, for instance, supports both
<code>~/.emacs.d/init.el</code> and <code>~/.emacs</code> for historical reasons, which
ends up causing confusing problems when both exist).</p></li>
<li><p>You should name your configuration directory after your program.</p></li>
<li><p>You should typically prefix your config directory with a <code>.</code> (but
see the final note for Linux, as configuration directories within
<code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code> should not be so prefixed).</p></li>
<li><p>On most OSs, putting your configuration files in the user’s “home”
directory is typical. I recommend the library
<a href="https://github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir">go-homedir</a>, rather than the <code>User.Homedir</code> available
in the stdlib from <a href="https://golang.org/pkg/os/user/"><code>os/user</code></a>. This is because use of
<code>os/user</code> uses <a href="https://golang.org/cmd/cgo/">cgo</a>, which, while useful in many situations,
also <a href="https://dave.cheney.net/2016/01/18/cgo-is-not-go">causes a number of difficulties</a> that can
otherwise be avoided - most notably, cross-compilation is no longer
simple, and the ease of deploying a static Go binary gets a number
of caveats.</p></li>
<li><p>On Linux specifically, I strongly encourage that you do <em>not</em> put
your configuration directory directly in the user’s home directory.
Most commonly-used modern Linux distributions use the
<a href="https://standards.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html">XDG Base Directory Specification</a> from
<a href="https://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/">freedesktop.org</a>, which specifies standard locations
for various directories on an end-user Linux system. (Despite this,
many applications don’t respect the standard and put their
configurations directly in <code>~</code> anyway). By default, this is
<code>~/.config/</code>, but it can also be set with the <code>XDG_CONFIG_HOME</code>
environment variable. Directories within this should <em>not</em> use a
leading <code>.</code>, as the directory is already hidden by default.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The following function should get you the correct location for your
config directory on all platforms (if there’s a platform with a
specific convention for config locations which I’ve missed, I’d
appreciate you letting me know so I can update the post - my email is
at the bottom of the page).</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "path/filepath"
    "os"
    "runtime"

    "github.com/mitchellh/go-homedir"
)

var configDirName = "example"

func GetDefaultConfigDir() (string, error) {
    var configDirLocation string

    homeDir, err := homedir.Dir()
    if err != nil {
        return "", err
    }

    switch runtime.GOOS {
    case "linux":
        // Use the XDG_CONFIG_HOME variable if it is set, otherwise
        // $HOME/.config/example
        xdgConfigHome := os.Getenv("XDG_CONFIG_HOME")
        if xdgConfigHome != "" {
            configDirLocation = xdgConfigHome
        } else {
            configDirLocation = filepath.Join(homeDir, ".config", configDirName)
        }

    default:
        // On other platforms we just use $HOME/.example
        hiddenConfigDirName := "." + configDirName
        configDirLocation = filepath.Join(homeDir, hiddenConfigDirName)
    }

    return configDirLocation, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>Within the config folder, you can use any filename you want for your
config - I suggest <code>config.toml</code>.</p>
<h2>Loading the config file</h2>
<p>To load a config file, you’ll first want to define the what config
values you’ll use. <code>burntsushi/toml</code> will ignore options in the TOML
file that you don’t use, so you don’t have to worry about that causing
errors. For instance, here’s the proposed configuration for a project
I’m maintaining, <a href="https://github.com/asciimoo/wuzz">wuzz</a> (the keybindings aren’t currently
implemented, but I’ve left them in for the sake of demonstration):</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type Config struct {
    General GeneralOptions
    Keys    map[string]map[string]string
}

type GeneralOptions struct {
    FormatJSON             bool
    Insecure               bool
    PreserveScrollPosition bool
    DefaultURLScheme       string
}
</code></pre>
<p>It’s pretty simple. Note that we use a named struct for
<code>GeneralOptions</code>, rather than making <code>Config.General</code> an anonymous
struct. This makes nesting options simpler and aids tooling.</p>
<p>Loading the config is quite easy:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "errors"
    "os"
    
    "github.com/BurntSush/toml"
)

func LoadConfig(configFile string) (*Config, error) {
    if _, err := os.Stat(configFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return nil, errors.New("Config file does not exist.")
    } else if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }
    
    var conf Config
    if _, err := toml.DecodeFile(configFile, &amp;conf); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &amp;conf, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p><code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will automatically populate <code>conf</code> with the values
set in the TOML file. (Note that we pass <code>&amp;conf</code> to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code>,
not <code>conf</code> - we need to populate the struct we actually have, not a
copy). Given the above <code>Config</code> type and the following TOML file…</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[general]
defaultURLScheme = "https"
formatJSON = true
preserveScrollPosition = true
insecure = false

[keys]

  [keys.general]
  "C-j" = "next-view"
  "C-k" = "previous-view"
  
  [keys.response-view]
  "&lt;down&gt;" = "scroll-down"
</code></pre>
<p>…we’ll get a <code>Config</code> like the following:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        DefaultURLScheme:       "https",
        FormatJSON:             true,
        PreserveScrollPosition: true,
        Insecure:               false,
    },
    Keys: map[string]map[string]string{
        "general": map[string]string{
            "C-j": "next-view",
            "C-k": "previous-view",
        },
        "response-view": map[string]string{
            "&lt;down&gt;": "scroll-down",
        },
    },
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Automatically decoding values</h2>
<p><code>wuzz</code> actually uses another value in its config - a default HTTP
timeout. In this case, though, there’s no native TOML value that
cleanly maps to the type we want - a <code>time.Duration</code>. Fortunately, the
TOML library we’re using supports automatically decoding TOML values
into custom Go values. To do so, we’ll need a type that wraps
<code>time.Duration</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type Duration struct {
    time.Duration
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next we’ll need to add an <code>UnmarshalText</code> method, so we satisfy the
<code>toml.TextUnmarshaler</code> interface. This will let <code>toml</code> know that we
expect a string value which will be passed into our <code>UnmarshalText</code>
method.</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func (d *Duration) UnmarshalText(text []byte) error {
    var err error
    d.Duration, err = time.ParseDuration(string(text))
    return err
}
</code></pre>
<p>Finally, we’ll need to add it to our <code>Config</code> type. This will go in
<code>Config.General</code>, so we’ll add it to <code>GeneralOptions</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">type GeneralOptions struct {
    Timeout                Duration
    // ...
}
</code></pre>
<p>Now we can add it to our TOML file, and <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will
automatically populate our struct with a <code>Duration</code> value!</p>
<p>Input:</p>
<pre><code class="language-text">[general]
timeout = "1m"
# ...
</code></pre>
<p>Equivalent output:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        Timeout: Duration{
            Duration: 1 * time.Minute
        },
        // ...
    }
}
</code></pre>
<h2>Default config values</h2>
<p>We now have configuration loading, and we’re even decoding a text
field to a custom Go type - we’re nearly finished! Next we’ll want to
specify defaults for the configuration. We want values specified in
the config to override our defaults. Fortunately, <code>toml</code> makes really
easy to do.</p>
<p>Remember how we passed in <code>&amp;conf</code> to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code>? That was an
empty <code>Config</code> struct - but we can also pass one with its values
pre-populated. <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> will set any values that exist in the
TOML file, and ignore the rest. First we’ll create the default values:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">import (
    "time"
)
var DefaultConfig = Config{
    General: GeneralOptions{
        DefaultURLScheme:       "https",
        FormatJSON:             true,
        Insecure:               false,
        PreserveScrollPosition: true,
        Timeout: Duration{
            Duration: 1 * time.Minute,
        },
    },
    // You can omit stuff from the default config if you'd like - in
    // this case we don't specify Config.Keys
}
</code></pre>
<p>Next, we simply modify the <code>LoadConfig</code> function to use
<code>DefaultConfig</code>:</p>
<pre><code class="language-go">func LoadConfig(configFile string) (*Config, error) {
    if _, err := os.Stat(configFile); os.IsNotExist(err) {
        return nil, errors.New("Config file does not exist.")
    } else if err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    conf := DefaultConfig
    if _, err := toml.DecodeFile(configFile, &amp;conf); err != nil {
        return nil, err
    }

    return &amp;conf, nil
}
</code></pre>
<p>The important line here is <code>conf := DefaultConfig</code> - now when <code>conf</code>
is passed to <code>toml.DecodeFile</code> it will populate that.</p>

apps using TOML with ease.</p>

<h4><a href="https://blog.artemix.org/article/show/kickstart">Kickstart, a fast and simple project template bootstrapper</a>

<span class="date">August 14, 2018 02:17 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Ever had some code base that you regularly use to start a new project?</p>
<p>Until now, you've probably lost some time refactoring everything to fill out the right project name, title etc.</p>
<p>A few tools already exist but either you're lost in feature bloating hell or you're fighting to configure everything in most cases.</p>
<p>The following tool is an early-developement, rust-based, template tool made to be more versatile that its closest python counter-part, <a href="https://github.com/audreyr/cookiecutter">cookiecutter</a>.</p>
<p>Also, it perfectly works on Windows, Linux and MacOS without any issue!</p>
<h2>A demonstration</h2>
<p>Let me demonstrate this tool from a user's point of view.</p>
<p>Say I'm John. I have a need to make several workers for my job queue.</p>
<p>All workers follow the same base structure and only a few bits of code change.
Error management is the same, etc.</p>
<p>Without any external tool,
the easiest way I could handle that would be to put the template in a Git repository,
clone it when needed and change the few fields,
like the handler's class name, the configuration file etc.</p>
<p>Still, I'd like to quickly bootstrap all my workers and not have to, by hand,
replace each key with the right value.</p>
<p>At the same time, I'm too lazy to set up an entire boostrapping suite or tool,
and I'd like to be able to make some very basic project templates that'd work almost out of the box.</p>
<p>My example of worker system uses the following file structure for worker classes:</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">.
├── {{name}}.java
└── template.toml</code></pre>
<blockquote>
<p>Yes, this tool supports templating in file and folder names!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>{{name}}.java</code> file contains the following very basic template code:</p>
<pre><code class="java">package org.artemix.worker;

class {{name}} extends WorkerBase {
        public void handle(Payload payload) {
                // Some default code
        }
}</code></pre>
<p>The <code>template.toml</code> contains a few template-specific fields (like its name, description and configuration format version), but also variable declaration for setup prompts.</p>
<pre><code class="toml">name = "Worker"
description = "Worker base template"
kickstart_version = 1

[[variable]]
name="name"
default="MyClass"
prompt="Which class name do you want to give to your worker ?"
validation="^[A-Z]\w+$"</code></pre>
<p>Here, with the validation regex, we can attest that we'll get a valid Java class file starting with a capitalized letter.</p>
<p>And that's it!</p>
<p>In a few instants, we created our worker template, and we have a nice base we can later grow if we need any new more complex worker.</p>
<p><em>Now, how do you create a worker with this template?</em></p>
<p>The easiest way is by simply running the following command from inside the folder in which you want the files to be created.</p>
<pre><code class="sh">$ kickstart /path/to/my/template</code></pre>
<p>This will parse the <code>template.toml</code> inside the given template path and,
for each <code>[[variable]]</code> block, will ask the prompt, validate the input,
and repeat until it's rightly entered.</p>
<p>Once all prompts have been resolved, it'll copy and parse the files into the current directory.</p>
<p><em>But I don't want to have all my templates in local, or pass the path every time!</em></p>
<p>Sure, having everything in local can be bothersome,
especially if you're starting a project from a huge project template.</p>
<p>To answer that, in the current version, kickstart supports cloning from a git remote by either HTTP(S), SSH or even git shortcuts!</p>
<p>In that sense, all the following commands are perfectly valid and will clone from a git remote.</p>
<pre><code class="nohighlight">$ kickstart git@gitlab.com:MyUser/MyTemplate
$ kickstart https://git.local/test
# With git shortcuts in the configuration, see https://stackoverflow.com/a/25975967/10165294
$ kickstart gl:MyUser/MyTemplate</code></pre>
<h2>In conclusion</h2>
<p>While still young, this tool is already, as-is, really useful and can handle a lot of situations.</p>
<p>Since the goal of this tool is to be as lightweight and basic as possible, you can have a fair
guarantee that it won't become an over-complex, feature-bloated, tool.</p>
<p>Not every feature has been showcased in this article, so I can only recommend you to go to the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/kickstart">official Github repository</a>,
and take a look at the <code>README.md</code> file, which should contains every information you'd need to learn how to use it.</p>
<p>As I publish this article, the official <code>v0.1.7</code> version have been released, and you can find the relesae on the <a href="https://github.com/Keats/kickstart/releases">releases page</a>.
If you'd prefer to be on the latest version, you can simply clone the repository, and, while inside it, run <code>cargo builld</code> and have a working version just for you.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://www.junglecoder.com/blog/factorlang-review">Factor: An impressive stack-based language environment</a>

<span class="date">August 14, 2018 02:17 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Recently the <a href="https://factorcode.org">Factor</a> programming language had a new 0.98 release, after a 4 year hiatus after the 0.97 release. Finding this on lobsters, I decided to take Factor for a spin again, after years of having left it mostly alone to work on PISC. I decided I wanted to try to build a (still slightly buggy) <a href="https://gist.github.com/yumaikas/6c8aebf8b0baf20431e06bd20c47dec4">4-function calculator</a>, as I find that a good way to gauge how easy/hard it is to use a GUI system for small things, and as a way to gauge what Factor is like in general.</p>

<h3>The (quite frankly) awesome</h3>

<p>Probably by <em>far</em> the most impressive part of Factor that I&rsquo;ve seen so far: Factor is the second language I&rsquo;ve come across that I&rsquo;d comfortably take on a deserted island without an internet connection (the other being Go with it&rsquo;s godoc server). This is due to the fact that a) 95% of all Factor documentation I&rsquo;ve seen is accessible from the included Help browser, and b) the Factor debugger/inspector can inspect itself in great detail. This is the cherry atop Factor: You don&rsquo;t just get a REPL, you also get a <em>really</em> useful set of debugging tools (especially the object inspector), and can dig into any of the state in the system, and using the help tools, once you understand some basics, you stand a decent chance of being able to either correct the state, or diagnose the bug.</p>

<p>This sort of tooling is something that SmallTalk is famous for, but any time I&rsquo;ve tried SmallTalk, I&rsquo;ve usually bounced off of it because most SmallTalk implementations end up living in their own world, making it hard to bring some of my favorite programming tools with me, and making it hard to interact with the outside world (footnote 3). Factor, on the other hand, even though it has an image that can updated to keep state around, and has a really good debugger, still integrates well with the outside world.</p>

<p>Really well, in fact. It&rsquo;s easy to scaffold a vocabulary <code>USE: tools.scaffold &quot;vocabulary-name&quot; scaffold-vocabulary</code> , and then run <code>USE: editors.sublime</code> (or emacs, or vim, or any of about 24 other fairly popular editors), and then run <code>&quot;vocabulary-name&quot; edit</code> and have it open the vocabulary in the editor in question. This allows you to open up any of the Factor source code in the editor of your choice. And when you&rsquo;re ready to start using/testing the vocabulary, running <code>&quot;vocabulary-name&quot; reload</code> puts you right into compile-fixing mode, where you can fix the bug in question, and then reload the vocabulary. When I was working on a 4-function calculator using the Factor listener and Sublime Text, it was a <em>really</em> tight feedback loop.</p>

<p>The GUI framework has a pretty nifty sorta-FRP like approach to how to handles data binding in controls, allowing you to daisy chain models (data that can be updated over time) via arrows (models with a quotation they apply to a base model when it&rsquo;s data changes).</p>

<p>Also, Factor has a mostly working dark-mode setup (there are some sections of the inspector that have poor contrast, but the listener is in a good state), if you dislike the default black-on-white color scheme (I found it difficult for some of the late night hacking I was doing). Run the following commands in the listener (assuming Factor 0.98)</p>

<pre><code>USE: tools.scaffold 
scaffold-factor-boot-rc
</code></pre>

<p>Then edit the .factor-boot-rc to look like so:</p>

<pre><code>USE: ui.theme.switching 

dark-mode
</code></pre>

<p>Then then run <code>run-bootstrap-init save</code> in the listener, and close and re-open the listener. Viola, Factor&rsquo;s dark mode!</p>

<h3>Consequences of (relative) obscurity</h3>

<p>That being said, there are still a few rough edges with Factor. For one, even though most things are documented, and those that are not have easily accessible source, Factor itself has almost no Google presence, which means that you have to be comfortable digging though the included help docs a bit longer to sort things out. This played out in a few practical ways when I was working on the 4-function calculator. Until the end of the project, I missed that <code>gadgets</code> (Factor&rsquo;s equivalent for controls in WinForms) were subclasses of <code>rectangles</code>, which meant that I could set their width and height by storing to the <code>dim</code>(ension) on a gadget:</p>

<pre><code class="factor">&quot;Test&quot; &lt;label&gt; { 200 300 } &gt;&gt;dim &quot;example of a 200x300 label&quot; open-window 
</code></pre>

<p>I ended up looking around the documentation about 4 times before I made that connection. This is the sort of question that would be on stack overflow for a more popular language.</p>

<p>For another, I seemed to be running across rendering or state glitches in the listener that could cause buttons to be mislabeled. I&rsquo;m unsure what was leading to it, but it was distracting, to say the least. The other thing with Factor that became evident was the singled threaded nature of it&rsquo;s runtime (as of currently). When first making a search in the help system, it would lock up, sometimes as long as 10-15 seconds, as it was indexing or loading in the various articles and such into memory. This limitation has kept me from digging into some languages (like Ocaml, though there are a bunch of other reasons, like iffy Windows support) in the past, especially when alternatives like Go and Erlang with their strong multi-threaded runtimes exist, but I think I&rsquo;m willing to look past it in Factor for now, especially since I hear that there is a half decent IPC story for Factor processes.</p>

<p>The other consequence of all this was that it took me roughly 10-15 hours of noodling around with Factor, and writing an even smaller example GUI script to be able to get the linked calculator above done. I think I could build other new things with far less stumbling around, but it was a good reminder of how slow learning something new can be.</p>

<p>The other minor frustration I have with Factor is the fact that any file that does much work tends to accrete quite a few imports in its <code>USING:</code> line (the calculator I wrote has 23 imports across 4 lines, even though it&rsquo;s only 100 lines of code). This is mostly due to a lot of various Factor systems being split into quite a few vocabularies. I could see this being helpful with compilation</p>

<h3>Comparisons to PISC</h3>

<p>Factor was a big inspiration for <a href="https://pisc.junglecoder.com/">Position Independent Source Code</a> (PISC), especially since it gave me the idea of code quotations some basic ideas for a few stack shuffling operations and some combinators (like <code>when</code> or <code>bi</code>). Factor and PISC have diverged a decent amount, though Factor is far and away further down the general path I&rsquo;d been wanting to take PISC in terms of documentation and interactivity. Revisiting it after spending 3 years of assorted free time working with PISC demonstrated that in a lot of ways.</p>

<p>Factor has a much higher level of introspection. When making the calculator I only had to think in Factor, rather than thinking in both PISC and Go (which is common when writing PISC). I also didn&rsquo;t have to rebuild many building blocks to get where I was going, like I would in PISC, as Slava and the other maintainers have done a <em>lot</em> of the foundational work already. Revisiting Factor after having written so much PISC did make understanding the stack a lot easier. I imagine that stack management will be most people&rsquo;s struggle with Factor. I&rsquo;ve found that implementing a stack language helped me there, but for some people, they may just have to do some exercises with it.</p>

<h3>Conclusions</h3>

<p>I do anticipate building more side-projects in Factor, as I&rsquo;ve yet to try out the web framework, and I have a couple of ideas for websites in the back of my mind. There&rsquo;s a <em>lot</em> of vocabularies that come with the base Factor download. I get the feeling that I may be adding some to it in the future, though time will tell.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://sgoel.org/posts/nim-first-impressions/">Nim: First impressions</a>

<span class="date">August 13, 2018 10:00 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>As someone who writes software for a living, I think it's a good idea to learn a
new language/technology every once in a while. It makes you think differently
from what you've been focusing on in your normal 9-to-5.</p>
<p>In that spirit, I started playing around with <a href="https://nim-lang.org/">Nim</a> last weekend. Nim is a neat
little language that has been around for a bit more than 10 years, but has been
(surprisingly) under the radar, at least if you compare it to how much publicity
Go and Rust generate.</p>
<p>The promise looks quite nice - high performance, (optional) garbage collection,
dependency-free binaries, compilation to JavaScript (!), and a clean syntax that
at times reminds me of Python.</p>
<p>After working through the <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut1.html">official tutorial</a> and <a href="https://nim-by-example.github.io/getting_started/">Nim by Example</a> over the
weekend, I've come to really like the language. There are some quirks that I
wish weren't there, but I'll try to summarize my first impressions in the
following sections.</p>
<h3>The Compiler</h3>
<p>If you're used to writing code in an interpreted language, "fighting the
compiler" can be a thing.</p>
<p>But I'm pleased to report that the Nim compiler, while pedantic like all others,
is actually quite helpful. The error messages are (for the most part) concise
and tell you exactly what you should do to turn your code into a binary.
And it's always nice to catch possible runtime errors at compile time.</p>
<p>For example, consider the following snippet that asks the user to enter a
number.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">strutils</span>

<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;What's your number? &quot;</span>

<span class="n">var</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">strutils</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">parseInt</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">readLine</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">stdin</span><span class="p">))</span>

<span class="n">case</span> <span class="n">number</span><span class="p">:</span>
  <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;One&quot;</span>
  <span class="n">of</span> <span class="mi">2</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">echo</span> <span class="s2">&quot;Two&quot;</span>
</pre></div>


<p>This fails to compile with the error message <code>not all cases are covered</code>, which
means that the compiler noticed that your <code>case</code> statement is not checking all
the possible cases and that this may cause unexpected behavior at runtime.</p>
<h3>Simple, but not really</h3>
<p>Nim looks small and simple on the surface, but it's a fairly advanced language.
There are features that let you do extremely funky things. You probably won't
end up using those features in daily use (well, depending on what you're using
it for), but you know that they are there.</p>
<p>I would argue that this is nice because the language feels approachable. It
feels like you can hold the entire language in your head (even though that may
not be the case). I don't feel the urge to hide in a corner on seeing Nim code
as a beginner to the language. At the same time you know it in the back of your
head that when you need to do advanced things, you can.</p>
<h3>Dependency-free binaries</h3>
<p>Coming from a Python world, this is <strong>huge</strong>. The <strong>simplest</strong> Python
deployments can still be fairly tricky to get right. There's the whole dance of
<code>virtualenv</code>s, installing dependencies, n-number of decisions you need to take
before even starting. And god help you if you need to install something that's
not pure Python.</p>
<p>Nothing is simpler than compiling the project and putting <strong>one binary</strong> on the
server and seeing things work.</p>
<h3>Compile-time constants</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>const value = doSomethingExpensive()
</pre></div>


<p><code>value</code> is set here at <strong>compile-time</strong>. Of course, if <code>doSomethingExpensive</code>
cannot be worked out at compile-time, the compiler will shout at you. But when
you're looking to reduce every single bit of runtime overhead, this is extremely
valuable.</p>
<h3>Productivity</h3>
<p>It was fascinating to observe that after spending effectively only a few hours
with the language, I felt like I was in a position to write <strong>working</strong> code.
I've had multiple moments writing Nim code when you write something and then
look at it and then go "was that it?".</p>
<p>The last time something like this happened was when I started learning Python.
It was astonishing that a programming language could put you in a position where
you can write <strong>working</strong> code so quickly.</p>
<h3>Variable assignment</h3>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>var x, y = 3
</pre></div>


<p>This sets the value of both <code>x</code> and <code>y</code> to be <code>3</code>, which seems slightly
confusing. Go does not compile something similar, complaining that there are 2
variables but 1 value.</p>
<p>To be honest, this is not a huge deal, but I can definitely see myself debugging
bugs caused by this behavior.</p>
<h3>Methods</h3>
<p>From <a href="https://nim-lang.org/docs/tut2.html#object-oriented-programming-methods">methods</a>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Adding a method to a class the programmer has no control over is impossible
or needs ugly workarounds.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>This is mentioned under the section "disadvantages". I don't think this is a
disadvantage. I would actually argue that this keeps the programmer from doing
funky things that harm readability.</p>
<p>I once spent 2 days trying to debug an issue in a Ruby on Rails codebase where a
third-party gem was monkey-patching some functions defined in <code>ActiveRecord</code>.
This was a classic example of modifying something you're not supposed to modify.</p>
<h3>Module import semantics</h3>
<p>So far this has been my biggest complaint with Nim.</p>
<p>Consider this simple program.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="n">strutils</span>

<span class="k">let</span> <span class="n">s</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s">&quot;Hello, World!&quot;</span>

<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">s</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">()</span>
<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">strutils</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="n">echo</span> <span class="n">split</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">s</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>


<p>The last three lines are all doing the same thing. So not only is the <code>split()</code>
function suddenly available on strings, but is also (optionally) a part of the
local namespace. It's difficult to say if <code>split</code> is a part of <code>strutils</code> or a
built-in function or a function defined on <code>string</code> types (if you didn't notice
the <code>import strutils</code>).</p>
<p>After writing Python code for slightly more than 10 years, I have "explicit is
better than implicit" plastered all over my brain. So such behavior makes me a
little uneasy.</p>
<p>From what I understand, this is a consequence of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uniform_Function_Call_Syntax">Uniform Function Call
Syntax</a>, but IMHO this feels like a step back in terms of being able to look at
a piece of code and immediately make sense out of it.</p>
<p>But the Nim developers know this complaint. There's already a <a href="https://github.com/nim-lang/Nim/issues/8013">Github issue</a>,
and the <a href="https://forum.nim-lang.org/t/3783">forum thread</a> even has a proposal that might be implemented in one of
the next releases. So I'm hopeful!</p>
<hr />
<p>Overall, I like Nim. If it's not painfully obvious, this article barely
scratched the surface. There is so much more to the language that I haven't
written about here for the sake of keeping this article short.</p>
<p>There are some design-things which I either don't get or don't agree with. But
on the other hand it provides many nice features without necessarily
compromising on speed or introducing complexity. My first attempt at picking up
one of the new systems-programming languages was at Rust, but it introduced so
much complexity that it was overwhelming.</p>
<p>Nim feels approachable, and gives you the feeling that it's powerful for when
you need something more than just simple.</p>
<p>Given that I've spent less than a week working with it and still like it so
much, I can definitely see myself writing more Nim code in the future.</p></div>

<span class="date">August 13, 2018 12:00 AM</span>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Last time we wrote about using Elixir to generate all possible voicings of a given guitar chord <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">to find the voicing with the best voice leading between another chord</a>.</p>

<p>While this was great, there were several issues. We were conflating the idea of “musical distance” and “physical distance” when calculating optimal voice leading, and we weren’t taking the playability of the progressions we were generating into account.</p>

<p>To address both of these issues, we need to know not only <em>which</em> voicings are possible for a given chord, but also <em>how</em> each of those voicings can be played. We need to generate all possible fingerings for a given guitar chord voicing.</p>

<p>This sounds like a fantastic excuse to flex our Elixir muscles!</p>

<h2 id="calculating-fingerings">Calculating Fingerings</h2>

<p>We’ll start our journey into calculating all possible fingerings for a given guitar chord by creating a new Elixir module, <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Fingering</span></code>, and a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Fingering do
  def fingerings(chord)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Our high level plan of attack for computing possible fingerings is fairly straight forward. Given that each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir#rendering-chords">a six-element array of frets being played</a>, like <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">5</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">7</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">6</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">]</span></code>, we want to:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Attach all possible fingerings that can be played on each fret.</li>
  <li>Choose each possible finger in turn, sieve out all subsequent impossible fingers, and recursively repeat to get all possible fingerings.</li>
  <li>Perform any necessary cleanup.</li>
</ol>

<p>Our final <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function makes these steps fairly explicit:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def fingerings(chord),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; attach_possible_fingers()
    |&gt; choose_and_sieve()
    |&gt; cleanup()
</code></pre>

<h2 id="possible-fingers-sieves">Possible Fingers? Sieves?</h2>

<p>Before we dive deeper into our solution, we should take a detour and talk about how we’re computing fingerings.</p>

<p>Our solution takes inspiration from the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sieve_of_Eratosthenes">“Sieve of Eratosthenes”</a>, which is a clever technique for calculating prime numbers. The basic idea of a “sieve” is that a choice made <em>now</em> can be used to filter out <em>future</em> unwanted results.</p>

<p>To bring it back to our situation, imagine we’re trying to play a D minor chord on the fifth fret:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/Dm.png" />
  <p>Our D minor chord.</p>
</div>

<p>If we were to start fingering this chord by placing our second finger on the low D note, we know that we couldn’t use our first finger on any of the other notes in the chord. Our first finger would have to wrap over or sneak under our second finger to reach those notes, and that’s essentially impossible:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/sieve.png" />
  <p>We can't use our first finger anywhere!</p>
</div>

<p>So by choosing to use our second finger on the fifth string and fret, we can sieve out the possibility of using our first finger on any of the remaining notes.</p>

<p>If we think about it, we can also sieve out the possibility of re-using our second finger. A finger can’t be re-used unless it’s forming a bar or a double-stop on an adjacent fret.</p>

<p>Our remaining set of possible fingers for the remaining notes are fingers three and four.</p>

<p>By recursively picking another of our possible fingers on another string and applying our sieving rules, we can come up with our entire set of possible fingers.</p>

<h2 id="choosing-and-sieving">Choosing and Sieving</h2>

<p>The meat of our algorithm lives in the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function, which takes an initial <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, complete with “possible fingers”, and a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> argument that defaults to an empty list:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve(chord, fingerings \\ [])
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> argument will be used to hold each finger choice for our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, as we choose them.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function expects each element of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> to be a two-element tuple, where the first element is the fret being played, and the second element is the set of possible fingers that could be chosen to play that fret.</p>

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">attach_possible_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function transforms our initial chord into that expected structure:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp attach_possible_fingers(chord),
  do: Enum.map(chord, &amp;{&amp;1, 1..4})
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Our implementation of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is recursive, so we should start our implementation by defining our base case. The base case for <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> is triggered when <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is empty. At that point, we’ve handled every note in the chord, and need to return our fully constructed fingering:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([], fingerings),
  do:
    fingerings
    |&gt; Enum.reverse()
    |&gt; List.to_tuple()
</code></pre>

<p>As we’ll soon see, chosen fingers are appended onto <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> in reverse order, so we <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">reverse</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> our list to reorient our strings. Lastly we turn our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> list into a tuple so that we can safely <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">flatten</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> our resulting list of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> without losing our groupings.</p>

<p>Once flattened, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">cleanup</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function maps over this final list and converts each tuple back into an array:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp cleanup(fingerings),
  do: Enum.map(fingerings, &amp;Tuple.to_list/1)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Moving on from our base case, it’s time to start thinking of other simple to handle situations.</p>

<p>If the next element in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> list is an unplayed string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>), we add it to our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code> list and designate it to be played with no finger (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>), and recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> on our remaining <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{nil, _possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do: choose_and_sieve(chord, [{nil, nil} | fingerings])
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, if the next element of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is an open string, we’re recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>, passing in our remaining <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and our set of fingers appended with the open string played with no finger (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>):</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{0, _possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do: choose_and_sieve(chord, [{0, nil} | fingerings])
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>In the case of actually needing to finger a note, the situation becomes more complicated. In that case, the next element of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> is a fret and some set of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code>.</p>

<p>We’ll map over each of the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code>, appending each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">finger</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fret</span></code> to our list of <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fingerings</span></code>, sieving out any now-impossible <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingerings</span></code> from the remaining notes in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and then recursively calling our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">choose_and_sieve</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function with our newly sieved <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code> and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">new_fingerings</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp choose_and_sieve([{fret, possible_fingers} | chord], fingerings),
  do:
    possible_fingers
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn finger -&gt;
      new_fingerings = [{fret, finger} | fingerings]

      |&gt; choose_and_sieve(new_fingerings)

</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_chord</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function maps over each of the notes in what’s left of our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord</span></code>, and updates the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> tuple element to sieve any fingerings that are now deemed impossible to play after placing our most recent finger:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp sieve_chord(chord, fingerings),
  do:
    chord
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {fret, possible_fingers} -&gt;
      {fret, sieve_fingers(possible_fingers, fret, fingerings)}
    end)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function is where we make real decisions about the behavior of our fingering algorithm. The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">sieve_fingers</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> function itself is fairly straight forward. It simply rejects and <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> that are considered “bad” by our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bad_finger?</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp sieve_fingers(possible_fingers, fret, fingerings),
  do: Enum.reject(possible_fingers, &amp;bad_finger?(fret, &amp;1, fingerings))
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">bad_finger?</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> function runs each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">finger</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fret</span></code> combinations through four rules used by our algorithm to determine if a finger choice is “impossible”, and should be culled from our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">possible_fingers</span></code> set:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp bad_finger?(fret, finger, fingerings),
  do:
    Enum.any?([
      fret_above_finger_below?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      fret_below_finger_above?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      same_finger?(fret, finger, fingerings),
      impossible_bar?(fret, finger, fingerings)
    ])
</code></pre>

<p>If any of those rules are violated, the finger is rejected.</p>

<p>The first two rules check if a possible finger would need to stretch over or under an already placed finger, respectively:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp fret_above_finger_below?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: fret &gt; new_fret &amp;&amp; finger &lt; new_finger

defp fret_below_finger_above?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: fret &lt; new_fret &amp;&amp; finger &gt; new_finger
</code></pre>

<p>The third rule verifies that no finger can be used twice, unless when performing a bar or double-stop over adjacent frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp same_finger?(fret, finger, [{new_fret, new_finger} | _]),
  do: finger == new_finger &amp;&amp; fret != new_fret
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, we need to prevent “impossible bars”, or bars that would mute notes played on lower frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp impossible_bar?(_fret, finger, fingerings = [{new_fret, _} | _]),
  do:
    fingerings
    |&gt; Enum.filter(fn {fret, _finger} -&gt; fret &gt; new_fret end)
    |&gt; Enum.map(fn {_fret, finger} -&gt; finger end)
    |&gt; Enum.member?(finger)
</code></pre>

<h2 id="the-results">The Results</h2>

<p>Now that we’ve implemented our fingering algorithm, let’s try a few examples.</p>

<p>We’ll start by calculating the possible fingerings for the D minor chord we’ve been using as an example. Fingering suggestions are listed below each string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[nil, 5, 7, 7, 6, nil]
|&gt; Chord.Fingering.fingerings()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;Chord.Renderer.to_string/1)
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/Dm-voicings.png" />
  <p>Fingerings for our D minor chord.</p>
</div>

<p>Awesome! The first suggested bar can be difficult to play, but with some practice doing <a href="http://forums.tedgreene.com/post/how-to-do-a-a-ted-greene-double-stop-8526262">Ted Greene-style double-stops</a>, it’s manageable. The second and third suggestions are what I would normally reach for.</p>

<p>Another interesting example is an open G major shape:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[3, 2, 0, 0, 3, 3]
|&gt; Chord.Fingering.fingerings()
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;Chord.Renderer.to_string/1)
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/G-voicings.png" />
  <p>Fingerings for our G chord.</p>
</div>

<p>The first few fingering suggestions make sense, but as we get closer to the end of the list, some of the suggestions are increasingly difficult to play. I don’t think I’ll ever be able to play this fingering:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/algorithmically-fingering-guitar-chords-with-elixir/G-bad-voicing.png" />
  <p>An "impossible" to play fingering.</p>
</div>

<p>As a human, I can explain to you why this is difficult to play, but I haven’t been able to come up with a general rule to add to our rule set that would prevent these kinds of fingerings from being suggested. At this point, I’d rather have the algorithm present <em>potentially impossible</em> fingerings, than have it over-aggressively prune <em>possible</em> fingerings from the result set.</p>

<h2 id="whats-next">What’s Next?</h2>

<p>In my previous article on <a href="http://www.petecorey.com/blog/2018/07/30/voice-leading-with-elixir/">“Voice Leading with Elixir”</a>, I mentioned that I was conflating the ideas of “musical distance” and “physical distance”. In terms of voice leading, all I really care about is optimizing a chord progression for musical distance. But as a guitar player, I also want to consider “physical distance”.</p>

<p>If a set of chords all have the same “musical distance” from a given starting chord, I want to choose the chord that has the lowest “physical distance”. By “physical distance”, I mean literally fret distance, but also how difficult it is to transition from one chord to another. Do I just need to slide one finger? That’s easy! Do I need to lift and replace three fingers while sliding the fourth? That’s not so easy…</p>

<p>We can’t calculate the “physical distance” between chords unless we know the fingerings for the chords in question. Now that we know the potential fingerings for a given chord, we can compute a (modified) <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Levenshtein_distance">levenshtein distance</a> between the fingerings of two chords!</p>

<p>Why is that cool?</p>

<p>Once that’s done, we’ll be able to take a starting chord (optionally with a starting fingering), and find the best voicing of the landing chord in terms of voice leading and ease of playability!</p>

<h4><a href="https://vfoley.xyz/rust-compile-speed-tips/">How to alleviate the pain of Rust compile times</a>

<span class="date">August 11, 2018 11:10 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>A few days ago, I wrote about two <a href="https://vfoley.xyz/rust-at-work/">Rust pain points</a> when using Rust at work.  One of these points were the long compile times.  In this post, I want to share a few tips that can help alleviate that pain.</p>

<h2 id="use-cargo-check">Use <code>cargo check</code></h2>

<p>We typically use the compiler for two reasons: to verify if the syntax and/or types are correct and to generate a runnable program.  When compiling a program, especially a release build, the majority of the time is spent generating LLVM bytecode and optimizing that bytecode.  If you only want to know whether your 3-line change typechecks, you don&rsquo;t want to wait for the optimizer.</p>

<p>For this reason, Cargo has a subcommand called <code>check</code> that only invokes the front-end.  It completes faster than a debug build and much faster than a release build.</p>

<p>As an example, here are the timing results of <code>cargo check</code> and <code>cargo build</code> for my personal project, ppbert.  (The benchmarks are performed by <a href="https://github.com/sharkdp/hyperfine/">hyperfine</a>.)</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo check

  Time (mean ± σ):      8.131 s ±  0.424 s    [User: 24.234 s, System: 1.245 s]

  Range (min … max):    7.529 s …  8.845 s

Benchmark #2: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build

  Time (mean ± σ):     16.904 s ±  0.794 s    [User: 52.009 s, System: 2.240 s]

  Range (min … max):   15.728 s … 18.098 s

Benchmark #3: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release

  Time (mean ± σ):     48.454 s ±  2.540 s    [User: 145.644 s, System: 3.205 s]

  Range (min … max):   46.229 s … 54.107 s

Summary

  'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo check' ran
    2.08x faster than 'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build'
    5.96x faster than 'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release'
</code></pre>

<p>From a clean slate, <code>cargo check</code> is 2x faster than <code>cargo build</code> and 6x faster than <code>cargo build --release</code>.  During development, when you just want to check that what you wrote is correct, definitely reach for <code>cargo check</code>.</p>

<h2 id="use-sccache">Use <code>sccache</code></h2>

<p>A co-worker introduced me to <a href="https://github.com/mozilla/sccache/"><code>sccache</code></a>, a compilation caching service by Mozilla that is compatible with Rust.  It will cache the build artifacts that Cargo generates, so if you <code>cargo clean</code> your project or go to work on a second project that shares dependencies with the first one, you won&rsquo;t have to rebuild everything.</p>

<p>You can install <code>sccache</code> with Cargo: <code>cargo install sccache</code>.  To activate <code>sccache</code>, add the following line to your <code>.bashrc</code>:</p>

<pre><code>export RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache
</code></pre>

<p>And here are the time differences.</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build

  Time (mean ± σ):     15.726 s ±  0.330 s    [User: 50.183 s, System: 2.210 s]

  Range (min … max):   15.148 s … 16.210 s

Benchmark #2: cargo clean &amp;&amp; RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache cargo build

  Time (mean ± σ):      6.877 s ±  4.665 s    [User: 6.964 s, System: 0.916 s]

  Range (min … max):    5.135 s … 20.136 s

  Warning: The first benchmarking run for this command was
  significantly slower than the rest (20.136 s). This could be caused
  by (filesystem) caches that were not filled until after the first
  run. You should consider using the '--warmup' option to fill those
  caches before the actual benchmark. Alternatively, use the
  '--prepare' option to clear the caches before each timing run.

Summary

  'cargo clean &amp;&amp; RUSTC_WRAPPER=sccache cargo build' ran
    2.29x faster than 'cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build'
</code></pre>

<p>Given the ease of installing and configuring <code>sccache</code>, I see no reason not to use it and get that 2x speed boost.  One downside of <code>sccache</code>: it won&rsquo;t make your continuous integration builds faster.  (You could configure <code>sccache</code> to use an S3 bucket, but I prefer to have completely clean builds from my CI.)</p>

<h2 id="avoid-lto">Avoid LTO</h2>

<p>LTO is the acronym for link-time optimization.  Compilers build and optimize compilation units individually.  LTO is a mechanism for taking those individually-optimized object files and finding more opportunities for optimization when they are considered as a group.  This is great if you want to have the fastest possible program, but the price you pay are higher compilation times.  In Rust, the compilation unit is the crate; if the heavy computations are all done in your crate, then maybe LTO isn&rsquo;t necessary.</p>

<p>Here is the difference in execution time of ppbert with and without LTO on a 100 MiB .bert2 file.</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: /tmp/ppbert-without-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2

  Time (mean ± σ):      1.926 s ±  0.005 s    [User: 1.308 s, System: 0.618 s]

  Range (min … max):    1.921 s …  1.937 s

Benchmark #2: /tmp/ppbert-with-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2

  Time (mean ± σ):      1.887 s ±  0.012 s    [User: 1.273 s, System: 0.613 s]

  Range (min … max):    1.867 s …  1.905 s

Summary

  '/tmp/ppbert-with-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2' ran
    1.02x faster than '/tmp/ppbert-without-lto -2 /tmp/100m.bert2'
</code></pre>

<p>There is a slight difference (which is why I enable LTO), but let&rsquo;s look at what LTO does to compile times (with sccache enabled):</p>

<pre><code>Benchmark #1: sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=false/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release

  Time (mean ± σ):      5.793 s ±  0.075 s    [User: 11.390 s, System: 0.767 s]

  Range (min … max):    5.693 s …  5.901 s

Benchmark #2: sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=true/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release

  Time (mean ± σ):     18.483 s ±  0.321 s    [User: 34.288 s, System: 1.182 s]

  Range (min … max):   17.971 s … 18.893 s

Summary

  'sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=false/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release' ran
    3.19x faster than 'sed -i &quot;s/lto.*/lto=true/&quot; Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo clean &amp;&amp; cargo build --release'
</code></pre>

<p>LTO makes the compilation of ppbert 300% longer for a 2% speed gain at run-time.  If you have a project that you find too long to build, I encourage you to measure the compile times with and without LTO, and the execution speed with and without LTO.  Maybe you&rsquo;ll find (like I did in a project at work) that you don&rsquo;t want to enable LTO.</p>

<h2 id="control-your-dependencies">Control your dependencies</h2>

<p>Rust has a rich ecosystem, and every day we have access to more quality crates.  This is mostly a blessing, but more crates mean more compilation, and this has a negative effect on your compile times.  Now, don&rsquo;t shun all dependencies and write everything yourself!  Rather, make sure that the crates your bring in pay for themselves.</p>

<p>One thing that you can do to control dependencies is to examine your depdendencies and see if they have features that you can disable.  For instance, in ppbert I use <a href="https://clap.rs">clap</a> to parse command-line arguments; by default, clap colors its output and offers suggestions when the user makes a spelling mistake.  Some people like these features, but I&rsquo;m not a fan myself.  Fortuately, the authors of clap have made such features optional.  So I am able to deactivate what I don&rsquo;t need, and not pay the compilation price for it.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the dependency tree of clap with default-features enabled, and without.</p>

<pre><code>$ rg default-features Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo tree -p clap
33:default-features=true
clap v2.31.2
├── ansi_term v0.11.0
├── atty v0.2.11
│   └── libc v0.2.42
├── bitflags v1.0.3
├── strsim v0.7.0
├── textwrap v0.9.0
│   └── unicode-width v0.1.5
├── unicode-width v0.1.5 (*)
└── vec_map v0.8.1

$ vi Cargo.toml

$ rg default-features Cargo.toml &amp;&amp; cargo tree -p clap
33:default-features=false
clap v2.31.2
├── bitflags v1.0.3
├── textwrap v0.9.0
│   └── unicode-width v0.1.5
└── unicode-width v0.1.5 (*)

</code></pre>

<p>So I only need to compile 4 external crates rather than 9.  Many crates make some of their dependencies optional; make sure you only bring in what you really need.</p>

<h2 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h2>

<p>Rust doesn&rsquo;t have the fastest compiler in the world, and that creates friction when writing code.  I&rsquo;m looking forward to improvements on that front more than any other Rust feature.  Fortunately, in the mean time, there are ways to make Rust compile your projects a little faster.</p></div>

For example, if everybody on a team spends 10% of their time communicating with every other team member: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_983_53228ac33bf0a8e89d936c5688d95fe7.png" alt="S={1+0.1}/{2*0.1}approx 5" title="S={1+0.1}/{2*0.1}approx 5" />.</p>
<p>In this team of five, 50% of each persons time will be spent communicating.</p>
<p>If <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_9e79376eca8627e5db439d0719bf41af.png" alt="alpha=0.8" title="alpha=0.8" />, then we have <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_956.5_00622bd826c8549884e0b418068b5d43.png" alt="S=({1+0.1}/{(1+0.8)*0.1})^{1/0.8}approx 10" title="S=({1+0.1}/{(1+0.8)*0.1})^{1/0.8}approx 10" />.</p>
<p>What if the percentage of time a person spends communicating with other team members has an exponential distribution?  That is, they spend most of their time communicating with a few people and very little with the rest; the (normalised) communications overhead is: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_994_d1937a3b362d1ca10f809b7db13408e9.png" alt="1-e^{-(S-1)t_1}" title="1-e^{-(S-1)t_1}" />, where <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_986.5_d007e05a0ddcdf6ce72b72790f24f6d7.png" alt="t_1" title="t_1" /> is a constant found by fitting data from the two-person team (before any more people are added to the team).</p>
<p>The maximum team size is now given by: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_979_9587e89c6e7daa27599435e8b4d69812.png" alt="S=1/{t_1}" title="S=1/{t_1}" />, and if <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_987_8b59394b0a72e46fb1747a9d35acffe8.png" alt="t_1=0.1" title="t_1=0.1" />, then: <img src="http://shape-of-code.coding-guidelines.com/wp-content/plugins/wpmathpub/phpmathpublisher/img/math_983_e65cac11851dc592d229a296d5189a9a.png" alt="S=1/{0.1}=10" title="S=1/{0.1}=10" />.</p>
<p>In this team of ten, 63% of each persons time will be spent communicating (team size can be bigger, but each member will spend more time communicating compared to the linear overhead case).</p>
<p>Having done this analysis, what is now needed is some data on the distribution of individual communications overhead.  Is the distribution linear, square-root, exponential?  I am not aware of any such data (there is a chance I have encountered something close and not appreciated its importance).</p>
<p>I have only every worked on relatively small teams, and am inclined towards the distribution of time spent communicating not being constant.  Was it exponential or a power-law?  I would not like to say.</p>
<p>Could a communications time distribution be reverse engineered from email logs?  The cc&#8217;ing of people who might have an interest in a topic complicates the data analysis; time spent in meetings are another complication.</p>
<p>Pointers to data most welcome and as is any alternative analysis using data likely to have a higher signal/noise ratio.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://sgoel.org/posts/switching-from-keepassxc-to-bitwarden/">Switching from KeePassXC to Bitwarden</a>

<span class="date">August 06, 2018 10:00 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I have been looking to replace my password management setup for a few months
now. Up until now I was using <a href="https://keepassxc.org/">KeePassXC</a>, but I never got around to putting in
the work to make it work properly on mobile.</p>
<p>I understand that the standard solution is to just get the file synced on your
phone using Dropbox and then install a mobile app which can read the file off of
Dropbox. But the idea that all my passwords are in one single file somewhere on
the internet (cloud, if you will) is a bit disturbing.</p>
<p>Incidentally, this is also the reason I never got around to using <a href="https://1password.com/">1password</a>,
<a href="https://www.lastpass.com/">Lastpass</a>, or other cloud-hosted password managers.</p>
<p>This is not to discount the work that the security folks at these companies are
putting in on a daily basis to make their services secure. And I know that my
passwords file is encrypted. I've just seen enough mistakes happen and I'd like
to avoid being a part of one.</p>
<h3>Requirements</h3>
<p>My requirements were fairly simple. I wanted something that</p>
<ol>
<li>is open-source</li>
<li>allows self-hosting</li>
<li>works on mobile</li>
</ol>
<p>... in that order.</p>
<p>Turns out that just these 3 requirements narrowed down the search to
<a href="https://bitwarden.com/">Bitwarden</a>.</p>
<h3>Bitwarden</h3>
<p>Bitwarden is <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden">open source</a>. There's a <code>core</code> server written in C# and then there
are multiple client apps (iOS, Android, desktop).</p>
<p>The backend appears quite heavy weight. Being written in C# and talking to a SQL
server installation, it's not exactly what I would call "deployment friendly".
Luckily, they provide a <a href="https://github.com/bitwarden/core#deploy">Docker image</a> which you can use to self-host the whole
thing.</p>
<p>While this works on a modern machine, I wanted to run Bitwarden on a spare
Raspberry Pi connected to my home network where the system requirements are a
bit less than what the Docker image requires.</p>
<p>It turns out that I'm not the first person to run into this problem. <a href="https://jcs.org">@jcs</a>
already <a href="https://jcs.org/2017/11/17/bitwarden">wrote</a> a <a href="https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden">Ruby server</a> which is API-compatible with the "official"
Bitwarden backend. This implementation is <strong>very</strong> lightweight, and completely
doable for the Pi. So all I had to do was create a new <code>bitwarden</code> user on the
Pi, install <code>rvm</code>, <code>git clone</code> the repository, and then start the server
process.</p>
<p>The only problem left now was setting up a static IP for the Pi so that the
desktop client on my laptop and the iOS app on my phone know the
(static &amp; private) IP address they should be connecting to. Luckily my modem
supported allocating the same IP to devices based on their MAC addresses so this
was also easy.</p>
<h3>Migrating from KeePassXC</h3>
<p><a href="https://github.com/jcs/rubywarden">rubywarden</a> includes a script to import existing KeePassXC database files, and
it worked without any problems. The script somehow didn't handle my KeePassXC
folders very well. So an entry called "Google" in the "Internet" folder was
imported as "Internet/Google". Those slashes look pretty annoying, so I took
some time out to delete some unused passwords and organize the rest into
folders.</p>
<p>Migration was a non-issue, I would say.</p>
<h3>Caveats</h3>
<p>The only caveat with this system that I can think of right now is that when
you're not at home, you won't be able to save/edit/delete passwords. You'll be
able to read just fine, but editing won't work.</p>
<p>The reason is that your client apps are configured to talk to a private IP
address (of the Pi in this case). But so far I haven't had the need to
save/edit/delete passwords when I'm outside. And reading them works just fine.</p>
<p>If this is important for you, then this is probably the price you pay for
keeping the passwords on a machine you can physically look at.</p>
<p>But overall, I find this setup quite nice to work with.</p></div>

PDF, or Portable Document Format, is an incredibly complex file format, governed by many standards and semi-standards. Like HTML and CSS, it was primarily designed for document layout and presentation. Also like HTML and CSS, it has been augmented with a JavaScript engine and document API that allows programmers to turn PDF documents into applications - or vehicles for malware.

Wallaroo is designed to help you build stateful event processing services that scale easily and elastically. State is partitioned across workers in the system and migrates when workers join or leave the cluster. Wallaroo routes messages to the correct worker by extracting a key from the message&rsquo;s content. Our initial implementation of Wallaroo was designed so that all of the keys that would be used by the system were known when defining the application.</div>

<span class="date">July 30, 2018 06:08 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I've been interested in <strong>VIA</strong> motherboards and CPUs ever since they came
up with the <strong>Mini-ITX</strong> standard in the very early 2000s. Their approach
of bringing fanless and power efficient designs to the x86 market was
ground breaking at the time.</p>

<p>VIA processors are designed by <strong>Centaur Technology</strong>, and there is an
excellent documentary entitled "<a href="https://vimeo.com/ondemand/riseofthecentaur">Rise of the Centaur</a>" retracing their
history, which I really enjoyed watching.</p>

<p>It's unfortunately very difficult to find information about recent VIA x86
CPUs. The VIA QuadCore, their latest one, was <a href="https://www.viatech.com/en/2011/05/via-announces-new-via-quadcore-processor/">announced</a> in May 2011,
and it remains an open question whether there will be newer ones or not,
as the company seems to be focusing on the ARM architecture.</p>

<p>In fact the status of VIA's x86 licensing agreement is quite unclear. There
was an <a href="https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/press-releases/2010/08/ftc-settles-charges-anticompetitive-conduct-against-intel">FTC ruling against Intel</a> in 2010 specifying that a five years
extension should be offered to VIA once the ongoing agreement would expire
in 2013, and that the agreement should be modified to allow VIA (among other
companies) to consider mergers or joint ventures. The later being the way
VIA apparently took, which gave birth to <a href="http://en.zhaoxin.com/">Zhaoxin</a>.</p>

<p>Some information in English about <strong>Zhaoxin x86 CPUs</strong> is available on
<a href="https://en.wikichip.org/wiki/zhaoxin">WikiChip</a>. However, those CPUs seems to only be available within China.
For now?</p>

<p>Given the current state of affairs on the x86 market (Intel ME, AMD Secure
Technology, Meltdown, Spectre) and upcoming vulnerabilities annoucements
lurking on the horizon, there is definitely a spot for alternative x86
processors.</p></div>

<p>The amount and maturity of the tools available to help developers in process of building new applications and products is often crucial to the success of any given technology, platform or ecosystem.</p>
<p>Nowadays in this blockchain trend we are witnessing, the front runner and most mature contender is Ethereum, for sure. The quality and quantity of the tools and content (documentation, tutorials, etc) available to developers in order to build on top of it, is miles away from the competition.</p>
<p>Recently I&#8217;ve been working and experimenting with NEO blockchain (<a href="https://blog.ovalerio.net/archives/tag/neo">as you can see on some of my previous posts</a>), a team that I took part even won an<a href="https://neo.org/blog/details/3074"> award of merit in their most recent dApp competition</a> (<a href="https://github.com/blocksmithtech/neo-vitae">Github repository</a>). During that period we felt the pain of the lack of maturity and documentation that affected this new &#8220;ecosystem&#8221;.</p>
<p>Things got better, but there are a few things still missing, such as tools that help you integrate your applications and services with the blockchain, tools to make the developer&#8217;s life easier and tools to make their dApps more useful, such as the equivalent to Ethereum&#8217;s <code>web3.js</code> and <code>Metamask</code>extension for example.</p>
<p>Even though you can achieve a lot with NEO&#8217;s JSON RPC API and through running your own node, I still think things should be easier. So at the last Whitesmith hackathon we&#8217;ve tried to address a subset of these pains.</p>
<p>We&#8217;ve put together, on that limited timeframe, a simple and rough service that delivers blockchain events as traditional Webhooks (websockets are planned) to make it easier for everybody to interact in real-time with any smart-contract.</p>
<p>We are looking for feedback to understand if it is something more developers also need and in that case work towards improving the service. Feel free to take a look at:</p>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I play quite a bit of guitar in my free time. Once of the things I’ve been practicing lately is improving my voice leading between chords.</p>

<p>Voice leading refers to how the individual notes, or voices, within a chord move when you transition to another chord. You often want as little movement as possible to keep the transition from sounding jarring (unless you’re going for jarring).</p>

<p>So for example, if I play a G7 way up the neck, I probably wouldn’t want to follow it with a Cmaj7 played towards the nut. Instead, I’d like to find another voicing of Cmaj7 that’s both physically and musically closer to our G7 chord.</p>

<p>Knowing how to voice lead between chords usually requires a vast knowledge of the fretboard, a huge chord vocabulary, and lots of practice. But who needs all then when you have a computer and <a href="https://elixir-lang.org/">the Elixir programming language</a>?</p>

<p>Let’s use Elixir to chug through all of the possible Cmaj7 chords and find those with the best voice leading from our G7!</p>

<h2 id="rendering-chords">Rendering Chords</h2>

<p>Before we start talking about recruiting our computer to help us find the best voice leading between chords, we should take a detour and talk about guitar chords and how we’ll work with them.</p>

<p>When you break it down to the basic, a “guitar” is just six strings attached to a piece of wood. A “chord” is just a set of notes played simultaneously across any number of those strings. Different notes can be played on each string by pressing on any “fret” along the neck.</p>



<p>Given those definitions, the simplest ways to represent a chord using Elixir data structures probably be as a six element list (or tuple).</p>

<p>Here’s our G7 chord represented as an array:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]
</code></pre>

<p>From the thickest string to the thinnest, we’re not playing anything on the first string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>). We’re playing a G on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">10</span></code>), a D on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">12</span></code>), an F on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">10</span></code>), a B on the next string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">12</span></code>), and nothing on the thinnest string (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>).</p>

<p>To make our lives easier, we should come up with some way of displaying these chords in a more guitarist-friendly manner. One common option for displaying guitar chords is with <a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/images/lessons/students/PaulVachon/HowToReadTedGreeneChordDiagrams.pdf">chord charts</a>:</p>

<p>To kick things off, let’s write a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span></code> module with a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function that takes a chord and returns a unicode-based chart for the provided chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defmodule Chord.Renderer do
  def to_string(chord, chord_name) do
  end
end
</code></pre>

<p>The first thing we’ll need to do is find out the “reach” of our chord. What’s the lowest fret used in the chord and the highest?</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
{min, max} =
  chord
  |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
  |&gt; Enum.min_max()
</code></pre>

<p>We can use Elixir’s <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">reject</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> to filter out unplayed strings and then use <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Enum</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">min_max</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> to easily find both the lowest and highest fret used in the chord.</p>

<p>Next we’ll iterate over every set of frets within the range of the chord and render each row using a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">row_to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">4</span></code> helper function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
0..max(max - min, 3)
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;row_to_string(&amp;1, min, chord, chord_name))
</code></pre>

<p>Most fret charts render some minimum number of rows, even if the chord only takes up one fret of vertical space. We’ll iterate between <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> and either <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">max</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">min</span></code>, or <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">3</span></code>, depending on which value is larger. This means we’ll always render at least four rows of frets for each diagram.</p>

<p>We’ll also want to intersperse the horizontal fret lines below each row of fingered notes on each row of frets:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.intersperse([:bright, :black, "\n   ├┼┼┼┼┤\n"])
</code></pre>

<p>We’re using <a href="https://hexdocs.pm/elixir/IO.ANSI.html">Elixir’s ANSI color codes</a> to color our fretboard lines a dark grey color, and building our final string as <a href="https://www.bignerdranch.com/blog/elixir-and-io-lists-part-1-building-output-efficiently/">an IO list</a>, rather than a single concatenated string.</p>

<p>Because we’re using ANSI color codes, we need to format and convert our resulting nested list structure into a string before returning it from our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; IO.ANSI.format()
|&gt; IO.chardata_to_string()
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>Our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">row_to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code> helper function is fairly straight forward. It simply renders a left gutter, the row of frets with any potential fingerings, and a right gutter:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp row_to_string(offset, base, chord, chord_name),
  do: [
    left_gutter(offset, base + offset),
    Enum.map(chord, &amp;fret_to_string(&amp;1, base + offset)),
    right_gutter(offset, chord_name)
  ]
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">left_gutter</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function renders the lowest fret used in the chord on the first line of the chart:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp left_gutter(0, fret),
    do: [:bright, :yellow, String.pad_leading("#{fret}", 2, " ") &lt;&gt; " "]
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, we render a spacer:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp left_gutter(_, _),
  do: "   "
</code></pre>

<p>Similarly, the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">right_gutter</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> helper function either renders an optional <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">chord_name</span></code> on the first line of the chord chart:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp right_gutter(0, chord_name),
  do: [:yellow, " #{chord_name}"]
</code></pre>

<p>Or an empty string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
defp right_gutter(_, _),
  do: ""
</code></pre>

<p>That’s all there is to it!</p>

<p>Now we can render chords by passing them into <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="no">Renderer</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">to_string</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code>:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.Renderer.to_string([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], "G7")
|&gt; IO.puts
</code></pre>

<pre class="language-*"><code class="language-*">10 │●│●││ G7
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││││││
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││●│●│
   ├┼┼┼┼┤
   ││││││
</code></pre>

<p>And in its fully colored glory:</p>

<div>
  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/voice-leading-with-elixir/G7.png" />
  <p>Our G7 chord, as rendered by our new module.</p>
</div>

<h2 id="chord-distance">Chord Distance</h2>

<p>We can roughly approximate how “good” the voice leading is between two chords by counting the number of frets each finger has to move when changing chords. We can call this the “distance” between the two chords. In the simplest terms, chords with good voice leading have minimal distance between each other.</p>

<p>If we can write a function that computes this distance between chords, we might be able to generate all possible Cmaj7 voicings, and find the voicing that leads best from our G7!</p>

<p>Let’s say that each fret moved on a single string equals one unit of “distance”, and adding or removing a note to or from a string also counts as a single unit of distance.</p>

<p>Using that heuristic, let’s write a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module and a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">distance</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">2</span></code> function that calculates the distance between two chords.</p>

<p>If both chords are equal, there is zero distance between them:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(chord, chord),
  do: 0
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, the distance between two chords is the sum of the distance between their individual fretted notes on each string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance([fret_a | rest_a], [fret_b | rest_b]),
  do: distance(fret_a, fret_b) + distance(rest_a, rest_b)
</code></pre>

<p>If a the first chord doesn’t have a note fretted on a string, and the next chord does, we’ll add one unit of distance:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(nil, fret),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>And visa versa:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(fret, nil),
  do: 1
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, if both strings have fretted notes, the distance moved on that string is the number of frets between the two chords on that string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def distance(fret_a, fret_b),
  do: abs(fret_a - fret_b)
</code></pre>

<p>We can manually calculate the distance between our G7 chord (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="p">[</span><span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">10</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="no">nil</span><span class="p">]</span></code>), and a few different Cmaj7 voicings we may know:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
Chord.distance([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], [nil, 3, 5, 4, 5, nil])   # 27
Chord.distance([nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil], [8, 10, 9, 9, nil, nil])  # 6
</code></pre>

<p>So according to our heuristic, the second voicing of Cmaj7 has much better voice leading between our G7 than the first voicing of Cmaj7.</p>

<p>This is great, but we’re still limited by our knowledge of the fretboard. What if we only know two voicings of a Cmaj7 chord. Is this the best we can do?</p>

<p>Absolutely not!</p>

<h2 id="brute-forced-voicings">Brute Forced Voicings</h2>

<p>The last piece of this puzzle is to write a function that will generate all possible voicings of a given chord across the neck of the guitar. If we have all of the possible voicings of our Cmaj7, for example, we can easily find the voicing that has the best voice leading from our G7 chord!</p>

<p>Let’s start by creating a new <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function in our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def voicings(notes) do
end
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function accepts an array of numbers representing the notes we want in our chord. For example, if we wanted all of the voicings of our Cmaj7 chord, we’d call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">vocings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> with a C (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>), an E (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">4</span></code>), a G (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">7</span></code>), and a B (<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">11</span></code>). These numbers correspond to the lowest set of <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a>, ranging from <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code> to <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">11</span></code>.</p>

<p>The first thing we want to do is calculate all of the possible “note sets” that will be spread across our guitar strings:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
notes
|&gt; all_note_sets()
</code></pre>

<p>If a chord has fewer notes than the number of strings we want to play, some number of those notes will have to be repeated. To illustrate, imagine we want to play our four note Cmaj7 using all six strings of the guitar. We’ll obviously have four strings playing C, E, G, and B, but what will the other two strings play?</p>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_note_sets</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper functions calculates this list of all possible note sets using some hand-waving combinatorics, and a few unfortunate list comprehensions:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def all_note_sets(notes) do
  for length &lt;- 6..length(notes) do
    for base &lt;- Combination.combine(notes, min(length, length(notes))) do
      for extension &lt;- Combination.combine(notes, length - length(notes)) do
        base ++ extension
      end
    end
  end
  |&gt; Enum.reduce(&amp;Kernel.++/2)
  |&gt; Enum.reduce(&amp;Kernel.++/2)
end
</code></pre>

<p>Next, our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> function needs to take each of these possible note sets and build all possible chords using that set of notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;build_chords/1)
</code></pre>

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">build_chords</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper works by recursively building up all possible chords made of all possible notes in the provided note sets.</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def build_chords(note_set, chord \\ [nil, nil, nil, nil, nil, nil], chords \\ [])
</code></pre>

<p>It starts by looking at the first note in the provided note set and finds all occurrences of that note across all of the strings of our guitar using the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_notes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
note
|&gt; all_notes
</code></pre>

<p>Next, it filters out notes on strings already used in the current chord under construction:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.filter(fn {string, fret} -&gt; Enum.at(chord, string) == nil end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, it takes each note, inserts it into the current chord, and checks the “stretch” of the chord. If the chord spans more than five frets, we deem it impossible to play and filter it out (which is obviously an over-simplification, especially at higher frets). Otherwise, we recursively call <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">build_chords</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">3</span></code>, passing in the newly updated current chord and the remaining set of notes in our note set:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {string, fret} -&gt;
  new_chord = List.replace_at(chord, string, fret)

  {min, max} =
    new_chord
    |&gt; Enum.reject(&amp;(&amp;1 == nil))
    |&gt; Enum.min_max(fn -&gt; {0, 0} end)

  if max - min &lt;= 5 do
    build_chords(rest, new_chord, chords)
  else
    chords
  end
end)
</code></pre>

<hr />

<p>The <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">all_notes</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper function works by accepting the abstract value of the note we’re looking for (C is <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="m">0</span></code>), the optional <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a> of the tuning of each string, and the optional number of frets up the neck we want to look for notes:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
def all_notes(target_note, strings \\ [40, 45, 50, 55, 59, 64], frets \\ 12) do
end
</code></pre>

<p>It then constructs a two dimensional list of <a href="http://www.inspiredacoustics.com/en/MIDI_note_numbers_and_center_frequencies">MIDI notes</a> up the neck and across the fretboard:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
fretboard =
  for fret &lt;- 0..frets,
    do: Enum.map(strings, &amp;(&amp;1 + fret))
</code></pre>

<p>Once we’ve built up our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">fretboard</span></code>, we’ll filter out all of the notes that aren’t the specific note we’re looking for. We loop over every row of frets, and every string:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
fretboard
|&gt; Enum.with_index()
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {row, index} -&gt;
  row
  |&gt; Enum.with_index()
  |&gt; Enum.map(fn {note, string} -&gt;
    ...
  end)
end)
</code></pre>

<p>For each <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">note</span></code> we encounter, we check if <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">rem</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">note</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="m">12</span><span class="p">)</span></code> equals our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">target_note</span></code>. If it does, we replace the current note value with a <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">string</span></code>/<code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">index</span></code> tuple that can be used when building our guitar chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
if rem(note, 12) == target_note do
  {string, index}
else
  nil
end
</code></pre>

<p>Otherwise, we replace the current note with <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">nil</span></code>.</p>

<p>Perfect.</p>

<p>Cool!</p>

<h2 id="putting-it-all-together">Putting it all Together</h2>

<p>Now that our <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="n">voicings</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="m">1</span></code> helper is finished, we can put all of the pieces together.</p>

<p>Let’s start by calculating all of the possible voicings of our Cmaj7 chord:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
[0, 4, 7, 11]
|&gt; Chord.voicings()
</code></pre>

<p>Next, let’s map over each voicing and build a tuple who’s first element is the distance from our G7 chord, and who’s second element is the generated voicing itself:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(&amp;{Chord.distance(&amp;1, [nil, 10, 12, 10, 12, nil]), &amp;1})
</code></pre>

<p>Now let’s sort that list. Because the distance from our G7 chord is the first element in each tuple, we’re effectively sorting by distance:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.sort()
</code></pre>

<p>Now the “best” options for Cmaj7 voicings should be at the top of our list. Let’s take the first three:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.take(3)
</code></pre>

<p>We’ll map each voicing through our chord chart renderer:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.map(fn {distance, chord} -&gt; Chord.to_string(chord, "Cmaj7") end)
</code></pre>

<p>Finally, let’s join each of our three charts together with newlines and print the result:</p>

<pre class="language-elixir"><code class="language-elixir">
|&gt; Enum.join("\n\n")
|&gt; IO.puts()
</code></pre>

  <p>Our generated Cmaj7 voicings.</p>
</div>

<p>Each of the voicings recommended by our software sound fairly nice. Much nicer than the first voicing we were using way down the neck. The third voicing definitely has an interesting flavor, and is something I never would have reached for without the help of this software, but I’m glad to know it’s there.</p>

<h2 id="final-thoughts-and-future-work">Final Thoughts and Future Work</h2>

<p>I have many, many final thoughts about this project. If you can’t tell, I’m incredibly excited about this kind of thing.</p>

<p>I’m currently working on improving the “distance” heuristic, which raises many interesting questions about what exactly voice leading is, and who it’s for. Should I optimize for the player, or the listener? Thanks to how the guitar works, chords on wildly different sections of the neck may be very close musically, but my algorithm will filter these chords out as being “too far.” In many ways, I’m conflating “voice leading” between chords with “playability” between chords. Is this what I want?</p>

<p>I’m also working on optimizing the voice leading over entire chord progressions.  As you might guess, this is a much more expansive problem.</p>

  <img src="https://s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/www.east5th.co/img/voice-leading-with-elixir/progression.png" />
  <p>A generated chord progression.</p>
</div>

<p>Lastly, if you’re interested in this kind of thing, I highly recommend you check out Ted Greene’s guitar work. Ted is, in my opinion, one of the true masters of the guitar, and put some serious work into perfecting his voice leading skills.</p>

<p>Check out the <a href="http://www.tedgreene.com/">Ted Greene archive</a>, the archive’s <a href="http://www.youtube.com/user/TedGreeneArchives">Youtube page</a>, and <strong>definitely check out two of Ted’s books: <a href="https://amzn.to/2uV6w1g">Chord Chemistry</a>, and <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Modern-Chord-Progressions-Classical-Voicings/dp/0898986982/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1532731370&sr=1-1">Modern Chord Progressions</a></strong>.</p>

<p>I’ve uploaded this entire project <a href="https://github.com/pcorey/chord">to Github</a>, if you’re curious the see the source in its entirety. Check it out!</p>

<p>Obviously, this kind of thing is just a tool, and the chord transitions and progressions generated by the <code class="language-elixir highlighter-rouge"><span class="no">Chord</span></code> module are just suggestions and starting places, not fully-fleshed out music. That being said, these tools have already given me many new ideas and shown me many interesting chords I never would have reached for without having them shown to me.</p></div>

<p>December 2017 — I had the privilege and opportunity of transitioning from Senior Developer at <a href="https://medium.com/unruly-engineering">Unruly</a> to a Team Lead of a newly-created team.</p><p>The new team was created to tackle a recurring issue at Unruly — our teams relied on multiple shared services for observability, alerting, and configuration management.</p><p>These services, while functional and only rarely prone to error, did not receive the same level of attention as our core products and therefore were only maintained, not advanced. <strong>When everyone is responsible, no-one is.</strong></p><p>Taking the name <em>SHIFT</em> (a shortening of <strong>Sh</strong>ared <strong>I</strong>n<strong>f</strong>rastructure <strong>T</strong>eam), we had an opportunity to start a team from scratch, without needing to cookie-cutter process from the core product teams … although we could, if we wanted.</p><img alt="" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1024/1*qlCtU74fvVrJ6Yb7bgSlCg.jpeg" />A snapshot from one of our team wipe-boards.<p>In this multi-part series, I’ll be recounting my experiences of the different facets of our team culture and process, deliberate <strong>and </strong>emergent behaviors, and how it has shaped our team’s direction.</p><p>This part is about what we do to create an environment with <strong>Psychological Safety</strong>.</p><p>I’ve been at Unruly for approaching six years, and with that comes six years of understanding from a <strong>lot</strong> of mistakes—however, a lot of that knowledge is specialized, and the team as a whole come from front-end/back-end development backgrounds, not infrastructure.</p><p>Thus, it was important for us to build a culture where asking questions and admitting gaps in knowledge was okay.</p><h4>What is psychological safety?</h4><p>For us, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychological_safety">psychological safety</a> was that <em>every member of the team felt safe taking risks: asking “silly” questions, putting forward their views and arguments, making mistakes.</em></p><p>A team of individuals that feel empowered to experiment, safe to make mistakes, and able to deal with conflict in a constructive and non-violent way will grow and learn incredibly quickly.</p><p>On a personal level, I wanted the team to feel happy working with each-other to tackle problems, and made it a top priority to embed this into our working practices and values.</p><h4>How did we build it into our team culture?</h4><ul><li><strong>Team Lead setting example</strong> — I have been deliberately bringing my whole self to work, to encourage openness and set a positive example.<br />I received a course of therapy earlier this year, to deal with some mental health issues, and I was very open about this with the team.<br />This is not to say that everyone should be open about everything, but should feel safe speaking about themselves if they need to, in public or in private.</li><li><strong>Regular feedback sessions</strong> — We have sessions to give each-other both positive and constructive feedback. Some of the “rules” are that no team member <em>has</em> to give or receive feedback, and that the feedback should be specific (not “You <strong>always</strong> do X”) and <a href="https://www.communicationandconflict.com/i-statements.html">I-statements</a> (not “<strong>You</strong> always do X”).</li><li><strong>Asking for clarification or more detail is fine</strong>—There will be different methods by which team members learn best even in a small team like ours. Some of the team are very visual learners, and learn best from diagrams, and some prefer analogies and metaphor.<br />We’ve tried to embed the idea that it’s okay for one member of the pair or mob to stop and ask for explanation in another form that helps them learn best.<br />This empathy helps tailor our explanations in the moment, and encourages cognizance of each-other’s needs</li><li><strong>Blameless post-incident retrospectives </strong>— The flip-side of being able to make mistakes safely is that when mistakes happen, we don’t point fingers and apportion blame.<br />If something in our process enabled an outage to be manually triggered, that’s a problem with the process, not the person.<br />We found <a href="http://retrospectivewiki.org/index.php?title=The_Prime_Directive">Norm Kerth’s Prime Directive</a> a good starting point: “<em>Regardless of what we discover, we understand and truly believe that everyone did the best job they could, given what they knew at the time, their skills and abilities, the resources available, and the situation at hand.”</em></li><li><strong>Not everything works for everyone</strong> — the tools above are fine and good, but they also make assumptions that everyone works the same way, or deals with questions/conflict equally. We encourage empathy and awareness of each-others’ needs where it’s <em>reasonable to expect </em>(e.g. social cues may not be as obvious to some people as others).</li></ul><p>There are many more things we do, as part of our conscious everyday practice and process, but these are the first concrete first steps.</p><p>We found that these processes and cultural axioms created an environment that supported different kinds of positive emergent behavior that we <em>did not expect</em>, and I’ll discuss in more detail in the next post, about our team’s sense of <strong>Belonging</strong>.</p><img src="https://medium.com/_/stat?event=post.clientViewed&referrerSource=full_rss&postId=ea43d46cdbc6" width="1" height="1" /></div>

<h4><a href="https://sulami.github.io/How this blog is madeHow this blog is made">How this blog is made</a>

<span class="date">July 26, 2018 12:00 AM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>While this blog has always been powered by a static-page generator, a while ago I switched from using <a href="https://blog.getpelican.com/">Pelican</a>, a Python-based generator, to <a href="https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/">Hakyll</a>, a Haskell-based one. There was no real practical reason for this, and objectively the switch has been a huge waste of time, though I have learned a lot about Haskell and am very happy with how this blog currently works.</p>
<p>The basic setup is quite simple, I am using <a href="https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/">Stack</a> to manage build dependencies and sandboxing for Haskell<span><label for="sn-1" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-1" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">This is actually one of my basic requirements for new languages that I pick up. It is 2018, you can ship your language with a package manager that sandboxes by default. One of my biggest problems with Python is virtualenv.<br />
<br />
</span></span>. For reasons that become clear later in this post, I also need a LaTeX installation, which currently is not managed in any way, but I do not require anything out of the ordinary, so usually it is just a matter of install ing the distribution for my operating system.</p>
<h2 id="hakyll-hacks">Hakyll Hacks</h2>
<p>To achieve a nice, human-readable URL scheme I am not only generating a slug from the original file name, which usually matches the title, but to get rid of the ugly <code>.html</code> postfix I actually render all pages and posts to <code>index.html</code> files in directories with the corresponding name, resulting in URLs with trailing slashes. Credit for this goes to <a href="https://www.rohanjain.in/hakyll-clean-urls/">Rohan Jain</a>.</p>
<p>Of course this blog also has an Atom feed<span><label for="sn-2" class="margin-toggle sidenote-number"></label><input type="checkbox" id="sn-2" class="margin-toggle" /><span class="sidenote">Atom vs. RSS has been <a href="https://nullprogram.com/blog/2013/09/23/">debated for a while</a>, in the end my use case is super simple anyway, so I am just using Atom until I find an actually valid reason to get into comparing the two formats.<br />
<br />
</span></span>, so you can follow my posts in your favourite newsreader, or use Firefox live bookmarks for example. I ran into one particular problem with this though, as one of my recent posts included an ampersand (&amp;) in the title. The rendered feed file (no matter the format) would be invalid due to this. So I had to implement <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percent-encoding">URL encoding</a> for titles myself (this is already done for the body by Hakyll). Thanks to the way Hakyll embraces the Haskell philosphy, this was just a matter of mapping the encoding function over the post titles for the feed output.</p>
<h2 id="symetric-html-pdf-output">Symetric HTML &amp; PDF output</h2>
<p>A long while ago I had the idea of making my CV available online in the browser, like many front end developers do to showcase their skills. At the same time I still need a PDF version that can be printed neatly. Being a developer, I of course cannot fathom the idea of having two sets of CVs, so I thought why not generate both versions from the same source (of truth), using one single build process. So that is what I am currently finalising.</p>
<p>The HTML version for the website is just a static page in the blog, simple enough. Hakyll gives me very fine-grained control over the actual build process, so I can leverage custom Markdown tags to control layout if I need to. The PDF version of my CV has always been generated using <a href="https://www.latex-project.org/">LaTeX</a>, because it generates beautifully rendered output in a reproducible fashion. Because I am using <a href="http://pandoc.org/">Pandoc</a> to generate HTML from the Markdown source, I am also using it to generate the LaTeX source code from the same source, and then just pass it into a LaTeX template. Then I just run <code>xetex</code> in a subprocess to render the final PDF.</p>
<h2 id="deployment">Deployment</h2>
<p>This blog is currently hosted in two locations, <a href="https://pages.github.com/">Github Pages</a> which I have been using for many years, and <a href="https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/pages/">GitLab pages</a>, which I only added recently. While the build and deployment process for these two platforms is slightly different, they mostly work off the same codebase, with the only difference being a <a href="https://github.com/sulami/sulami.github.io/blob/develop/Makefile">makefile for Github</a> being replaced by the <a href="https://gitlab.com/sulami/sulami.gitlab.io/blob/develop/.gitlab-ci.yml">GitLab-specific build file</a>. The Github version I generate locally with my locally compiled Hakyll, and then push the the right branch using the makefile. This makefile also allows me to run a local server to preview the rendered output before committing. The GitLab repository is setup to mirror the one on GitHub and rebuild via GitLab CI on every change, so it is compiling the Hakyll application in a Docker container and the generating the output.</p>
<p>These two build processes have different pros and cons. The GitHub version is available slightly faster, as my local render only takes a couple of seconds and after pushing I just have to wait for Github’s cache to refresh, which usually takes only a couple of minutes, while the GitLab version has to run the CI job which takes a couple of minutes. On the upside the GitLab version does not require me to have a locally installed version of Haskell, Stack or anything else, as long as I can push to the repository, allowing me to explore workflows which happen end-to-end on iOS. I have been investigating this exact workflow, using a combination of <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/ia-writer/id775737172">iA Writer</a>, <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/workflow/id915249334">Workflow</a> and <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/working-copy/id896694807">Working Copy</a> to write, transform and push the posts, leaving the build process to GitLab CI.</p>
<p>If you are interested in details, have a look at the source on either <a href="https://github.com/sulami/sulami.github.io">Github</a> or <a href="https://gitlab.com/sulami/sulami.gitlab.io">GitLab</a>.</p></div>

<p>One thing I wanted to think about is, speaking as someone working in this field and interested in making changes in my day-to-day life, what kind of tools or ideas would be useful for me? What should I do?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>Alongside this thought, another thought I had is that somehow the big lists of rules feel very impersonal and disconnected from my experiences. I also feel a little bit unsatisfied about opt-in rules. Here’s a few from the around the place, that I’ve seen:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
<a href="https://futureoflife.org/ai-principles/">Future of Life</a> (June 2018, relevant items)
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
5 - Race Avoidance: Teams developing AI systems should actively cooperate to avoid corner-cutting on safety standards.
</div></li>
<li><div>
6 - Safety: AI systems should be safe and secure throughout their operational lifetime, and verifably so where applicable and feasible
</div></li>
<li><div>
7 - Failure Transparency: If an AI system causes harm, it should be possible to ascertain why.
</div></li>
<li><div>
8 - Judical Transparency: Any involvement by an autonomous system in judicial decision-making should provide a satisfactory explanation auditable by a competent human authority.
</div></li>
<li><div>
9 - Responsibility: Designers and building of advanced AI systems are stakeholders in the moral implications of their use, misuse, and actions, with a responsibility and opportunity to shape those implications.
</div></li>
<li><div>
10 - Value Alignment: Highly autonomous AI systems should be designed so that their goals and behviours
</div></li>
<li><div>
11 - Human Values: AI Systems should be designed and operated so as to be compatible with ideals of human dignift, rights, freedoms, and cultural diversity.
</div></li>
<li><div>

<div>
<p>I have a few problems with these rules:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
It’s easy to imagine situations in which they are counter-productive,
</div></li>
<li><div>
I don’t feel a lot of ownership of them, as I wasn’t involved in their construction,
</div></li>
<li><div>
No-one is enforcing them on me,
</div></li>
<li><div>
They’re often highly impractical or contain colloquial/regional/policital concerns (“Boost French Research …”),
</div></li>
<li><div>
They’re also very overwhelming and demanding, how can I ensure that we do <em>all</em> of them?
</div></li>
<li><div>
Even if I <em>say</em> I’m doing these things, how does any non-technical person know? How can I prove it?
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>The positive aspects of them are:</p>
</div>
<div>
<ul>
<li><div>
It’s sometimes easy to think about how to apply them to day-to-day work,
</div></li>
<li><div>
They help me think of things that I might not care about day-to-day (i.e. the environmental concerns?),
</div></li>
<li><div>
It might help to lobby governments/organisations to get funding to make progress on certain aspects?
</div></li>
<li><div>
It provides a framework that might be useful for discussing with colleagues/other people
</div></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, what should any given engineer working in this area do? One thought I’ve had recently is a simple one: Let’s just aim at building empathy for the people that will be affected by our software.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>This is reasonably actionable, say, with local groups by organising meetings between technical people and the people that may be affected. I.e. in the medical-AI setting, let’s organise regular catch-ups between the engineers, the doctors, nursing staff, and hospital adminstration types, along with perhaps patient representatives.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>In the setting, of, say, law software, again we just set up regular events for the two groups to chat through issues, work together on small projects, and build a mutual understanding of difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>I think this approach is a bit nicer than, say, creating a new set of rules that make sense for us locally, and then forcing people to follow them. One idea I like about the empathy-based/collaborative approach (or “human-centered design”; another term for this kind thing), is that it allos people to <em>adapt to local circumstances</em>, which I think is really crucial in allowing any one person to feel like they have some control over the application of any rules they come up with, and thus getting them to actually take an interest in enforcing them in their organisation.</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>So, my new rule of thumb for this ethics-related AI stuff will be: Can I meet with some of the people that will be affected? What are their thoughts? What problems are they working through and what are they interested in?</p>
</div>
<div>
<p>As always, I’m interested in your thoughts on the matter!</p>

<h4><a href="https://asylum.madhouse-project.org/blog/2018/07/24/on-git-github-and-email/">GitHub vs mailing lists, from another perspective</a>

<span class="date">July 24, 2018 12:45 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>The other day, I made the mistake of getting involved in a kind of flamewar, that revolved around GitHub versus an email-driven workflow. As can be safely inferred, I do not subscribe to the email-driven workflow idea. There seem to be fundamental disagreements, and I think it's worth a shot to show my side of things.</p><p>In this first part, I will reflect on an article titled "<a href="https://begriffs.com/posts/2018-06-05-mailing-list-vs-github.html">Mailing lists vs Github</a>", which should have been titled "Mailing lists vs the GitHub web UI", but I digress. Lets cut to the chase!</p><h2>Critique</h2>
<blockquote><p>Code changes are proposed by making another Github-hosted project (a “fork”), modifying a remote branch, and using the GUI to open a pull request from your branch to the original.</p>
</blockquote><p>That is a bit of a simplification, and completely ignores the fact that GitHub has an API. So does GitLab and most other similar offerings. You can work with GitHub, use all of its features, without ever having to open a browser. Ok, maybe once, to create an OAuth token.</p>
<blockquote><p>Email sub-threads allow specialized discussion about different aspects or sections of the code. A linear Github-style discussion would mix those conversations.</p>
</blockquote><p>I'm not a fan of deep threads. If something has many sub-threads, or the thread goes too deep, for me that indicates that there's a deeper problem. That the patch may need to be split up, or discussed, or even re-designed first. A certain level of discussion is useful, but once it splits up into longer sub-threads, it becomes way too easy to loose sight of the whole picture.</p><p>GitHub's flat discussion discourages this, and I find that to be beneficial most of the time. There are times when I don't, but that happens rarely enough that I can live with it.</p>
<blockquote><p>On Github, comments continually change. They become “outdated” and disappear when attached to a line that has been changed. Same for the commits, which vanish after a force-push to the pull request branch. In an email thread, by contrast, the original messages and proposed changes remain for comparison with later messages and patches.</p>
</blockquote><p>On mailing lists, when you "force push", and start a new thread (or subthread at best) with the new version of a patchset, the history is similarly hard to use. You can link the new patchset to the older discussion, but comparsion has to be done manually. Same applies to GitHub. I don't see much of a difference here.</p><p>If you send updated patches, that's the same as pushing new commits on GitHub, which appear clearly, and still keep older comments available. Some may get marked outdated, but I consider that a good thing. I don't want to see typically irrelevant, already-addressed comments by default. I can still look at them if I want to, mind you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Furthermore, patches from multiple authors can’t mix in a Github pull request.</p>
</blockquote><p>Except, you can, and there are a number of ways to accomplish that. You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/allowing-changes-to-a-pull-request-branch-created-from-a-fork/">allow maintainers of the upstream repo</a> to edit your pull request. You can also give permission to other to collaborate with you on a repo, and push to your branches. The latter does give a bit wider access than one might wish, but it is an option. Furthermore, others can open pull request against the branch you used to open yours from. When you merge those, their commits will be added to the pull-request you opened.</p><p>This last one fits the GitHub pull-request model best, and when you are comfortable with working with GitHub, it is not any more complex to work this way than with e-mail. Instead of applying patchsets, you merge PRs. Both are supported by integrations, the difference in complexity is none.</p>
<blockquote><p>The pull requester must turn those comments into commits on the branch if he or she wants to incorporate the suggested changes.</p>
</blockquote><p>Or the commenter can send a pull-request against the branch the PR in question was opened from. You can have a discussion there, to discuss the changes (much like a subthread on the mailing list). You can even link the two together, and navigate between the two.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another nice effect is that other people can carry the patch to the finish line if the original author stops caring or being involved.</p>
</blockquote><p>On GitHub, if the original proposer goes MIA, anyone can take the pull request, update it, and push it forward. Just like on a mailing list. The difference is that this'll start a new pull request, which is not unreasonable: a lot of time can pass between the original request, and someone else taking up the mantle. In that case, it can be a good idea to start a new thread, instead of resurrecting an ancient one.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patch Format</p>
</blockquote><p>This is indeed a case where an e-mail based workflow is more flexible. Yet, does it matter? In either case, you can just apply the patch, and create diffs in whatever format, and as much context as you wish. You'll see not just the parts, but the whole thing in context. You can do this with GitHub, you can do this with email. I've been doing it ever since I started working with patches, and it is mighty convenient.</p><p>Use the tools you have, if you need and want to. You are not limited to the GitHub UI. Nor are you limited to your MUA, either. There are tools outside of those, tools you can integrate with. Use them.</p><p>Don't treat patches as discrete items. Apply them, and have a look at the whole. That gives you all the context you need, in whatever format you desire. I found this to be a very powerful workflow, one that is also easier to work with than patches, because the tree is easier to navigate this way. You can use tools that understand the code, to jump to definitions (that's a lot harder when you view a diff). You can apply code formatting, use refactoring tools to better understand the code - and then undo it all if so desired. You can edit and change code as you review, and work with the code the same way you normally do, using all the help your IDE can give you.</p>
<blockquote><p>Patch/Discussion mix</p>
</blockquote><p>You can link issues and pull requests on GitHub. IDEs with good integration allow easy navigation too, akin to navigating an e-mail thread. There are projects out there that separate bug report and development lists, which suffer from the same issue as GitHub's issue/pull request split.</p><p>This is not an inherent advantage of mailing lists. It's an advantage of not separating the two.</p>
<blockquote><p>While web apps deliver a centrally-controlled user interface, native applications allow each person to customize their own experience.</p>
</blockquote><p>GitHub has an API. There are plenty of IDE integrations. You can customize your user-experience just as much as with an email-driven workflow. You are not limited to the GitHub UI.</p>
<blockquote><p>Open protocols like SMTP encourage a proliferation of clients.</p>
</blockquote><p>There are all kinds of GitHub clients, each with their own added functionalities, each with their own set of features. Just like email clients, you have a wide selection to choose from.</p>
<blockquote><p>Mail clients provide ways to mark a message important, or set it back as unread.</p>
</blockquote><p>You can build something like that on top of the GitHub API. I believe that is what <a href="https://octobox.io/">Octobox</a> have been doing.</p><p>Again, you are not limited to the GitHub UI.</p>
<blockquote><p>Some people script their mail client so that they can apply patches with a keyboard shortcut, others go minimalist, and still others even use webmail. Each person is different, and so is their software, but the nature of the mailing list allows them all to work together.</p>
</blockquote><p>Nothing is stopping anyone from doing the same with GitHub. For example, I use Emacs and Magit to work with GitHub, never leaving my IDE. Others I collaborate with use the GitHub UI. Others use vim and other tools I have no clue about. Some others use Visual Code Studio or Atom. Or GitHub Desktop. Or in some cases, e-mail. We all work on the same projects.</p>
<blockquote><p>Another area of control is the ability to search and interact with a mailing list while offline.</p>
</blockquote><p>You can do that with GitHub too. With limitations, and a bit of preparation, but similar limits apply to working with a mailing list while offline, too.</p>
<blockquote><p>Github requires connectivity to review issues and pull requests.</p>
</blockquote><p>No. You can <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/checking-out-pull-requests-locally/">fetch the pull requests</a> you want to review before going offline.</p><p>You can also use the API to cache issues, and schedule updates.</p><p>A lot of people don't sync their mail locally either, so will have to do some preparations when going offline too. Those who do, can also set up automatic PR syncing too.</p><p>Again, you are not limited to what the GitHub UI offers. You can use additional tools, the same way you do when using an email-driven workflow. You aren't limited to what you MUA has to offer.</p>
<blockquote><p>With a native email client you can review all emails and attachments offline. You can even send replies to messages offline and the client will queue them until internet access becomes available.</p>
</blockquote><p>This assumes that one synced e-mail locally. Many people use IMAP or similar protocols, and typically don't sync for offline use. Doing so is most often a conscious decision. When you do decide that, you can also pull down PRs and issues first. There are existing tools to aid you in that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Tools can work together, rather than having a GUI locked in the browser.</p>
</blockquote><p>GitHub has an API. Granted, it is not an RFC, and you are at the mercy of GitHub to continue providing it. But then, you are often at the mercy of your email provider too.</p>
<blockquote><p>What a twist of history, then, that users of git chose Github… a centralized host granting free licenses for open source projects, and requiring projects to store their metadata on company servers.</p>
</blockquote><p>Except they do not do that. They provide you an API to look at the additional meta-data, to build custom integrations on top of it.</p><p>You can host your issues elsewhere. You can even use GitHub as a mirror only. You only need to host your metadata there, if you want to use the features GitHub provides. You are not in any way required to do that.</p><p>You can even opt to do both! You can accept GitHub issues, pull request, <strong>and</strong> have a mailing list! There is nothing stopping you from doing that.</p>
<blockquote><p>Github can legally delete projects or users with or without cause.</p>
</blockquote><p>Whoever is hosting your mailing list archives, or your mail, can do the same. It's not unheard of.</p>
<blockquote><p>An author can download the source release tarball, make changes in the copy, capture the diff, and email it.</p>
</blockquote><p>You can do the same with a project using GitHub. Send the e-mail to one of the maintainers. You are at the mercy of the recipients to deal with the patch appropriately, but that's the same situation when they use CVS/Mercurial/etc, and you send a bare patch. They still have a little work to do to fit it in their workflow.</p><p>But GitHub itself does not prevent accepting e-mail.</p>
<blockquote><p>Sending and applying patches cuts out busywork like cleaning up remote branches after merge, or creating a local branch in the forked repo in preparation for a pull request.</p>
</blockquote><p>All of this can be easily automated away. Besides, if you are a long-term contributor, creating a local branch is a good idea <em>anyway</em>, GitHub or not.</p>
<blockquote><p>For comparison, I remember teaching a group of new programmers how to use Github, and was conscious at the time of all the weird steps I asked them to do.</p>
</blockquote><p>For comparsion, when my Wife (a garden engineer, not a tech-savvy person) wanted to contribute a little during Hacktoberfest, she found the "Edit file" button on the UI, and went further from there on her own. No weird steps, just edit a file, submit changes, done.</p><p>She'd never be able to send an patch by e-mail.</p>
<blockquote><p>There’s also less busywork for finished communications. There aren’t things to “clean up” like abandoned pull requests, merged branches, or issues to mark closed. The replies just stop on those threads.</p>
</blockquote><p>I'd rather see an explicit marker that an issue is resolved or a PR is merged, but hey, that's me, who doesn't like to dig this information out of random e-mail threads. Discoverability is important.</p>
<blockquote><p>PGP provides a further guarantee of identity, verified through a decentralized web of trust.</p>
</blockquote><p>You can sign commits and tags while using GitHub. You can't sign comments, last I checked, but you can respond to them by email, which is signed. It might look a bit weird on the UI, but hey.</p>
<blockquote><p>Perhaps this article can start these developers on the path to rediscovering the care and engineering that went into classic email clients (“MUAs” as they are called).</p>
</blockquote><p>Or perhaps there are people who'd rather not deal with email, because they have purpose-built tools that aid them better than a MUA and tools built around that workflow would.</p><h2>Exceptions</h2><p>There are certainly projects where the GitHub model just doesn't work, the Linux kernel being one particularly great example of that. What works for one project, may not be the best choice for another. I assert that most projects are not the Linux kernel, and aren't anywhere near that level. As such, modeling your workflow on something with vastly different needs may not be the best course of action.</p><h2>Next up</h2><p>In the next installment of these series, I will explain my workflow. No comparisons, just examples of how I, an allegedly seasoned engineer of sorts, uses the tools he has at hand. It's a workflow of a power user. One who prefers working with APIs instead of email. It may include a little bit of history.</p><p>After that, I'll have a look at a few other posts that campaign for an email-driven workflow, and see where that takes us.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://gkbrk.com/2018/03/writing-a-simple-ipfs-crawler/">Writing a Simple IPFS Crawler</a>

<span class="date">July 23, 2018 03:54 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>IPFS is a peer-to-peer protocol that allows you to access and publish content in
a decentralized fashion. It uses hashes to refer to files. Short of someone
posting hashes on a website, discoverability of content is pretty low. In this
article, we&rsquo;re going to write a very simple crawler for IPFS.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s challenging to have a traditional search engine in IPFS because content
rarely links to each other. But there is another way than just blindly following
links like a traditional crawler.</p>

<h2>Enter DHT</h2>

<p>In IPFS, the content for a given hash is found using a <strong>D</strong>istributed <strong>H</strong>ash
<strong>T</strong>able. Which means our IPFS daemon receives requests about the location of
IPFS objects. When all the peers do this, a key-value store is distributed among
them; hence the name <em>Distributed Hash Table</em>. Even though we won&rsquo;t get all the
queries, we will still get a fraction of them. We can use these to discover when
people put files on IPFS and announce it on the DHT.</p>

<p>Fortunately, IPFS lets us see those DHT queries from the log API. For our
crawler, we will use the Rust programming language and the
<a href="https://crates.io/crates/ipfsapi">ipfsapi</a> crate for communicating with
IPFS. You can add <code>ipfsapi = &quot;0.2&quot;</code> to your Cargo.toml file to get the
dependency.</p>

<h2>Using IPFS from Rust</h2>

<p>Let&rsquo;s test if our IPFS daemon and the IPFS crate are working by trying to fetch
and print a file.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>api</span> <span>=</span> <span>IpfsApi</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"127.0.0.1"</span><span>,</span> <span>5001</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>bytes</span> <span>=</span> <span>api</span><span>.cat</span><span>(</span><span>"QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u"</span><span>)</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>
<span>let</span> <span>data</span> <span>=</span> <span>String</span><span>::</span><span>from_utf8</span><span>(</span><span>bytes</span><span>.collect</span><span>())</span><span>?</span><span>;</span>

<span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>data</span><span>);</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This code should grab the contents of the hash, and if everything is working
print &ldquo;Hello World&rdquo;.</p>

<h2>Getting the logs</h2>

<p>Now that we can download files from IPFS, it&rsquo;s time to get all the logged events
from the daemon. To do this, we can use the <em>log_tail</em> method to get an
iterator of all the events. Let&rsquo;s get everything we get from the logs and print
it to the console.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>for</span> <span>line</span> <span>in</span> <span>api</span><span>.log_tail</span><span>()</span><span>?</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>line</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This gets us all the loops, but we are only interested in DHT events, so let&rsquo;s
filter a little. A DHT announcement looks like this in the JSON logs.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight json"><code><span>{</span><span>
  </span><span>"duration"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>235926</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"event"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"handleAddProvider"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"key"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"peer"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"QmeqzaUKvym9p8nGXYipk6JpafqqQAnw1ZQ4xBoXWcCrLb"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"session"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"ffffffff-ffff-ffff-ffff-ffffffffffff"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"system"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"dht"</span><span>,</span><span>
  </span><span>"time"</span><span>:</span><span> </span><span>"2018-03-12T00:32:51.007121297Z"</span><span>
</span><span>}</span><span>
</span></code></pre></div>
<p>We are interested in all the log entries with the event <em>handleAddProvider</em>. And
the hash of the IPFS object is <em>key</em>. We can filter the iterator like this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>logs</span> <span>=</span> <span>api</span><span>.log_tail</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span>
        <span>.filter</span><span>(|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>"event"</span><span>]</span><span>.as_str</span><span>()</span> <span>==</span> <span>Some</span><span>(</span><span>"handleAddProvider"</span><span>))</span>
        <span>.filter</span><span>(|</span><span>x</span><span>|</span> <span>x</span><span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span><span>.is_string</span><span>());</span>

<span>for</span> <span>log</span> <span>in</span> <span>logs</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>hash</span> <span>=</span> <span>log</span><span>[</span><span>"key"</span><span>]</span><span>.as_str</span><span>()</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>()</span><span>.to_string</span><span>();</span>
    <span>println!</span><span>(</span><span>"{}"</span><span>,</span> <span>hash</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Grabbing the valid images</h2>

<p>As a final step, we&rsquo;re going to save all the valid image files that we come
across. We can use the <a href="https://crates.io/crates/image">image</a> crate. Basically;
for each object we find, we&rsquo;re going to try parsing it as an image file. If that
succeeds, we likely have a valid image that we can save.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write a function that loads an image from IPFS, parses it with the <em>image</em>
crate and saves it to the <em>images/</em> folder.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>fn</span> <span>check_image</span><span>(</span><span>hash</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>str</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>Result</span><span>&lt;</span><span>(),</span> <span>Error</span><span>&gt;</span> <span>{</span>

<h4><a href="https://gkbrk.com/2018/02/simple-dbus-service-in-python/">Writing a Simple D-Bus Service in Python</a>

<span class="date">July 23, 2018 03:54 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>D-Bus is a message bus that Linux systems use in order to make programs
communicate with each other or with the system itself. It allows applications to
integrate amongst themselves using well-defined interfaces. This allows each
application to provide services that can be used by others, sort of like adding
API&rsquo;s to your programs.</p>

<p>In this article, we&rsquo;re going to write a small D-Bus service and a client to
consume it. Perhaps some people see D-Bus as an ancient and scary relic of the
past, but hopefully after reading this you will find it an approachable topic.</p>

<h2>D-Bus Service for Getting the Current Time</h2>

<p>First of all, let&rsquo;s import <em>dbus</em> and <em>time</em>. This shouldn&rsquo;t be a big surprise
since we&rsquo;re writing a D-Bus service about time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code><span>import</span> <span>dbus</span>
<span>import</span> <span>dbus.service</span>
<span>import</span> <span>time</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Next, we need to create a D-Bus service class. This is done by inheriting from
<code>dbus.service.Object</code>. The functions we put into this class will be automatically
exported as D-Bus methods.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code><span>class</span> <span>Time</span><span>(</span><span>dbus</span><span>.</span><span>service</span><span>.</span><span>Object</span><span>):</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>self</span><span>.</span><span>bus</span> <span>=</span> <span>dbus</span><span>.</span><span>SessionBus</span><span>()</span>
        <span>name</span> <span>=</span> <span>dbus</span><span>.</span><span>service</span><span>.</span><span>BusName</span><span>(</span><span>'com.gkbrk.Time'</span><span>,</span> <span>bus</span><span>=</span><span>self</span><span>.</span><span>bus</span><span>)</span>
        <span>super</span><span>()</span><span>.</span><span>__init__</span><span>(</span><span>name</span><span>,</span> <span>'/Time'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This part just gets a connection to the Session Bus and sets the name of our
service. Let&rsquo;s write our function that returns the current time.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code>    <span>@dbus.service.method</span><span>(</span><span>'com.gkbrk.Time'</span><span>,</span> <span>out_signature</span><span>=</span><span>'s'</span><span>)</span>
    <span>def</span> <span>CurrentTime</span><span>(</span><span>self</span><span>):</span>
        <span>"""Use strftime to return a formatted timestamp
        that looks like 23-02-2018 06:57:04."""</span>

        <span>formatter</span> <span>=</span> <span>'</span><span>%</span><span>d-</span><span>%</span><span>m-</span><span>%</span><span>Y </span><span>%</span><span>H:</span><span>%</span><span>M:</span><span>%</span><span>S'</span>
        <span>return</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>strftime</span><span>(</span><span>formatter</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This method is a small wrapper around the strftime function from the standard
library, which formats the current time into a human readable string.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>I want to talk about the decorator for a bit. The <em>out_signature = &lsquo;s&rsquo;</em> part
basically tells D-Bus that the function returns a string. If we had made it
<em>out_signature = &lsquo;ss&rsquo;</em>, that would mean we are returning two strings from our
function, which is a tuple of strings in Python. Similarly, putting
<em>in_signature</em> there would let us denote the function arguments.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2>Running the Service</h2>

<p>In order to run the service, we&rsquo;re going to need a bit more boilerplate. The
code below creates the GLib main loop, registers our service and runs the
loop. The main loop will stop the program from terminating, so we can respond to
calls to our service.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code><span>if</span> <span>__name__</span> <span>==</span> <span>'__main__'</span><span>:</span>
    <span>import</span> <span>dbus.mainloop.glib</span>
    <span>from</span> <span>gi.repository</span> <span>import</span> <span>GLib</span>

    <span>dbus</span><span>.</span><span>mainloop</span><span>.</span><span>glib</span><span>.</span><span>DBusGMainLoop</span><span>(</span><span>set_as_default</span><span>=</span><span>True</span><span>)</span>

    <span>loop</span> <span>=</span> <span>GLib</span><span>.</span><span>MainLoop</span><span>()</span>
    <span>object</span> <span>=</span> <span>Time</span><span>()</span>
    <span>loop</span><span>.</span><span>run</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Writing a Client to Access Our Service</h2>

<p>Writing a client is a lot easier than writing the service. Again, we need to
import <em>dbus</em> and connect to the Session Bus for this.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code><span>import</span> <span>dbus</span>

<span>bus</span> <span>=</span> <span>dbus</span><span>.</span><span>SessionBus</span><span>()</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>After this, we will create our Time object again, using the <code>com.gkbrk.Time</code>
address we created before.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code><span>time</span> <span>=</span> <span>bus</span><span>.</span><span>get_object</span><span>(</span><span>'com.gkbrk.Time'</span><span>,</span> <span>'/Time'</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>Using this object, we can call any method we defined on the service and use the
result. Let&rsquo;s print the current time that we get from our D-Bus service.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight python"><code><span>curr</span> <span>=</span> <span>time</span><span>.</span><span>CurrentTime</span><span>()</span>
<span>print</span><span>(</span><span>'The current time is'</span><span>,</span> <span>curr</span><span>)</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If there are no problems; if you run the service we wrote in a terminal and run
the client from another terminal, you should get the time printed on your
console.</p>

<p>Now, you should be able to create simple services that are useful to you. If you
come up with any interesting services, I would love to hear about them via email
or Twitter.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gkbrk.com/2018/01/evolving-line-art/">Evolving Line Art</a>

<span class="date">July 23, 2018 03:54 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>In this article, I want to talk about a really simple technique for evolving line-art from pictures. On top of being an simple example for genetic algorithms, it is also a fun programming project that can be done in short time.</p>

<p>For this project, we are going to use the Hill Climbing algorithm. The algorithm for evolving pictures is like the following.</p>

<ol>
<li>Create two empty images, image 1 and image 2</li>
<li>Do a small random modification (like a line) to the first image</li>
<li>If the first image is closer to the target than the first one, copy it to image 2</li>
<li>Otherwise, copy the second image to image 1</li>
<li>Goto 2</li>
</ol>

<p>I will be using Rust for this project. Fortunately, Rust has really good libraries that we can use to read, manipulate and write image files.</p>

<h2>Loading the Target Image</h2>

<p>The image crate makes loading files really straightforward. Here&rsquo;s how to load the file called <code>target.png</code>. We will also create the two temporary images that we need for the algorithm. We will make those</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>target</span> <span>=</span> <span>image</span><span>::</span><span>open</span><span>(</span><span>"target.png"</span><span>)</span><span>.expect</span><span>(</span><span>"Cannot load target image"</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>img1</span> <span>=</span> <span>DynamicImage</span><span>::</span><span>new_rgb8</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.width</span><span>(),</span> <span>target</span><span>.height</span><span>());</span>
<span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>img2</span> <span>=</span> <span>DynamicImage</span><span>::</span><span>new_rgb8</span><span>(</span><span>target</span><span>.width</span><span>(),</span> <span>target</span><span>.height</span><span>());</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Extracting the Colours</h2>

<p>Normally, picking the colours randomly should work just as well as using the colours from the picture. But if we extract all the colours and pick randomly from those, the algorithm will be able to generate the images faster. To achieve this, we will create a Vector and store all the colours in there.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>colours</span> <span>=</span> <span>Vec</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>();</span>

<span>for</span> <span>pixel</span> <span>in</span> <span>target</span><span>.pixels</span><span>()</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>rgba</span> <span>=</span> <span>pixel</span><span>.</span><span>2</span><span>.to_rgba</span><span>();</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>!</span><span>colours</span><span>.contains</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>rgba</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>colours</span><span>.push</span><span>(</span><span>rgba</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Difference between two images</h2>

<p>To determine if an image is closer to our target, we need a function to find the difference of two images. The <em>root_mean_squared_error</em> from the <em>imageproc</em> crate does exactly that.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>fn</span> <span>image_diff</span><span>(</span><span>img1</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>DynamicImage</span><span>,</span> <span>img2</span><span>:</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>DynamicImage</span><span>)</span> <span>-&gt;</span> <span>f64</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>imageproc</span><span>::</span><span>stats</span><span>::</span><span>root_mean_squared_error</span><span>(</span><span>img1</span><span>,</span> <span>img2</span><span>)</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>This function returns the amount of difference between two images as a float. When we&rsquo;re building the hill climbing algorithm, our goal is going to be minimising this number.</p>

<h2>Drawing random circles</h2>

<p>Personally I like the art style of the random lines, but it evolves slowly. One way to speed-up the process and get a different art style is using different shapes. Perhaps the simplest shape that can be drawn is a circle. It only needs a location (x, y) and a radius. Here&rsquo;s how to draw a random circle with a radius of 5 in your image.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>pos</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>rng</span><span>.gen_range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.width</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>i32</span><span>),</span> <span>rng</span><span>.gen_range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.height</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>i32</span><span>));</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h2>Drawing random lines</h2>

<p>For drawing, we are going to be using the imageproc crate again. Here&rsquo;s how to draw a black line from (10, 10) to (20, 20).</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>start</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>10f32</span><span>,</span> <span>10f32</span><span>);</span>

<span>let</span> <span>color</span> <span>=</span> <span>Rgba</span><span>([</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>1</span><span>]);</span>

</code></pre></div>
<p>Let&rsquo;s draw a line with a color chosen from our random list.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>let</span> <span>mut</span> <span>rng</span> <span>=</span> <span>rand</span><span>::</span><span>thread_rng</span><span>();</span>

</code></pre></div>
<h2>The Hill Climbing Algorithm</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t know how it works, I have written about the <a href="https://gkbrk.com/wiki/hill_climbing/">hill climbing algorithm</a> in my wiki. Basically, it starts with a random solution and repeatedly mutates it in a way that it becomes better and better according an evaluation function we provide.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s write the skeleton of our hill climber. We&rsquo;ve already created the target image and the temporary images in the previous sections.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>loop</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>let</span> <span>pos</span><span>:</span> <span>(</span><span>i32</span><span>,</span> <span>i32</span><span>)</span> <span>=</span> <span>(</span><span>rng</span><span>.gen_range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.width</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>i32</span><span>),</span> <span>rng</span><span>.gen_range</span><span>(</span><span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>target</span><span>.height</span><span>()</span> <span>as</span> <span>i32</span><span>));</span>

    <span>if</span> <span>image_diff</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>img1</span><span>)</span> <span>&lt;</span> <span>image_diff</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>target</span><span>,</span> <span>&amp;</span><span>img2</span><span>)</span> <span>{</span>

    <span>}</span> <span>else</span> <span>{</span>
        <span>&amp;</span><span>img1</span><span>.copy_from</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>img2</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>,</span> <span>0</span><span>);</span>
    <span>}</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<h2>Saving regular snapshots</h2>

<p>Since this program can improve the image for a really long time, until it becomes a pixel-perfect copy of the target, we might want to save snapshots if the image we get in regular intervals. This will allow us to check the progress and stop the program once we are satisfied with the results. Let&rsquo;s save the image every 500 iterations.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight rust"><code><span>if</span> <span>i</span> <span>%</span> <span>500</span> <span>==</span> <span>0</span> <span>{</span>
    <span>img2</span><span>.save</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>mut</span> <span>File</span><span>::</span><span>create</span><span>(</span><span>&amp;</span><span>Path</span><span>::</span><span>new</span><span>(</span><span>"output.png"</span><span>))</span><span>.unwrap</span><span>(),</span> <span>image</span><span>::</span><span>PNG</span><span>);</span>
<span>}</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>And with that, the project is done. Here&rsquo;s the full code, in a form that compiles and runs. Play around with it, try new shapes and different algorithms. If you implement this in another language, let me know and share your own code with result pictures.</p>

<h4><a href="https://gkbrk.com/2018/01/welcome-2018/">Welcome 2018!</a>

<span class="date">July 23, 2018 03:54 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>Hello dear readers, welcome to another episode of &ldquo;New Year, New Me&rdquo;. First of all, I want to wish everyone a happy new year. Hopefully, 2018 will be full of happiness, health and success for you. For a variety of reasons some of you might have had a bad year. But worry not; because 2018 is here and whatever your goals were, you can keep trying.</p>

<p>Today I want to reflect upon the previous year and make some resolutions about the upcoming one. Personally, 2017 was a really good year for me. On the education, career and personal fronts, I made a lot of progress and had a lot of fun. Since I never got around to writing one of those for 2016, this post might have some older stuff as well.</p>

<h2>Reflecting on the previous year</h2>

<p>I finished my first year of university and started my second one. During this process I met a lot of interesting and cool people, like-minded individuals if you will. I always imagined university would be a fun place to be in but that was an understatement. If you use all the resources and facilities provided to you, it can be a very useful and valuable experience.</p>

<p>I got my first job during August 2017. I started working part-time as a web developer. This provided me with experience related to my field as well as some extra money. I think having my first job in my own field is a really good opportunity compared to just working a random job.</p>

<p>Other than my current job, I also found a placement for next year. I signed a contract with them around the end of 2017. After I finish my second year in school, I will be working in London as a full-time Software Engineer. I am really excited for this, I have met some people from the company as well as people from my team. They all feel like really nice people and I&rsquo;m looking forward to working with them.</p>

<p>I started learning Chinese (Mandarin if you&rsquo;re pedantic). Originally I was planning to learn Japanese, which would probably be easier for me because of similarities between Japanese and my native language, but in the end I decided to go with Chinese. So far I&rsquo;m pleased with my decision, although my progress is slow because of my heavy workload.</p>

<p>During the good and bad parts of the year, my amazing girlfriend stood by me and supported me a lot. She made the worst part of my year (and one of worst times of my life) bearable, and I am really thankful to have such a kind and loving person in my life. We have been in a long-distance relationship for a while, but I am going to meet her in a few days so I am really excited.</p>

<p>I spent the whole year with great people. I want to express my gratitude towards one of the really special ones. Melis, my former flatmate, has been an incredible friend. She made my already bright life even brighter. At this point, she is like a sister to me. We secretly believe that we are somehow telepathically connected, although we have not been able to find any scientific evidence for this. Anyway; she is my brotato, and hopefully she will stay that way for a long time.</p>

<h2>Resolutions for the new year</h2>

<p>Ah, so here is the part where I tell you about how I&rsquo;m going to become a completely better person compared to yesterday. Get ready for a whole bunch of empty promises that say how I&rsquo;m going to study 20 hours a day and do cardio on top of it. Joking aside, I believe these new-year resolutions are useful things. It&rsquo;s like a to-do list of things that would be good to try this year. Even if you don&rsquo;t accomplish all (or any) of them, it is still enough to try.</p>

<p>Here is my list for 2018.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Make progress in Chinese.</strong> I want to spend more time this year learning Chinese. My goal is practicing common words and sentence structures. Maybe I will be able to read a children&rsquo;s book by the end of this year.</li>
<li><strong>Write more blog posts.</strong> I think having a small number of blog posts is fine, as long as the content is interesting. But I would still like to write more regularly. At least once a month would be ideal.</li>
<li><strong>More gym.</strong> Although I walk a lot every day and prefer walking to the bus or Uber, I still think I need to be a little more active. I think the gym is a good way to spend time and become healthier at the same time.</li>
<li><strong>Eat healthier.</strong> Speaking of healthy, I want to focus on foods with more nutrients. This is not very easy since I don&rsquo;t have too much time for cooking, but a phone app can be helpful for keeping track of my food intake.</li>
<li><strong>Waste less time.</strong> I usually find myself needing more time for things, which makes me believe there is a lot of wasted time in my day. I bought an Android app that allows me to do &lsquo;Time-tracking&rsquo;. I am hoping that it helps me be a little more efficient with my time management, but I am scared it might turn into &ldquo;You watched 6 hours of Netflix today&rdquo;.</li>
<li><strong>Learn how to draw.</strong> I want to improve my drawing, which isn&rsquo;t in a very good condition now. My goal is to spend around 15-30 minutes every day to try drawing something simple.</li>
</ul>

<p>Is it a long list? Yeah. Is it likely that I will do everything in my list for the entire year? Probably not. But is it worth trying to do it and possibly improving yourself? Absolutely.</p>

<hr />

<p>I urge everyone to also write something short, reflecting on their year and making resolutions for the new one. Writing this down and sharing it with other people might provide some extra motivation.</p></div>

<h4><a href="https://gkbrk.com/2017/10/putting-my-blog-on-ipfs/">Putting My Blog on IPFS</a>

<span class="date">July 23, 2018 03:54 PM</span>
</h4>

<div class="entry">
<div class="content">
<p>I&rsquo;ve always been fascinated by the idea of peer-to-peer network protocols, and putting my website on a distributed network was something I&rsquo;ve been meaning to do for a while. The recent increase in blog posts about IPFS finally pushed me over the tipping point. Hopefully, you can read this article on IPFS <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/gkbrk.com/2017/10/putting-my-blog-on-ipfs/">here</a>.</p>

<p>I am really happy with this change, and I urge everyone to do the same with their websites. IPFS may or may not be the perfect solution to the decentralized web, but we need to start somewhere. In this article, I will try to give a step-by-step guide for putting static websites on IPFS.</p>

<h2>Getting started</h2>

<p>First, a bit about getting your feet wet with IPFS. Every file and directory in IPFS can be referenced by a hash that looks like <code>QmNiMm9LUX9R4Ezu2NAsraxFSyrbNR6rgGwCDu71Dy4NwQ</code>. If you have it installed on your computer, you can go on the command line to download and view files.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight shell"><code>ipfs <span>cat </span>QmWATWQ7fVPP2EFGu71UkfnqhYXDYH566qy47CnJDgvs8u
</code></pre></div>
<p>This command will output &lsquo;Hello World&rsquo;. I chose this as an example, because I assume hello world is something a lot of people will have on their nodes.</p>

<p>Just as easy as getting files, putting files is also easy. Lets say you have a picture of a cat called <code>kitten.jpg</code>. Running <code>ipfs add kitten.jpg</code> give you a hash and your node will start seeding it. You can just give that hash to people you want to share the file with. You can try it like <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipfs/Qmd286K6pohQcTKYqnS1YhWrCiS4gz7Xi34sdwMe9USZ7u">this</a>.</p>

<h2>Putting a website on IPFS</h2>

<p>So how do we go from putting up a file there to putting up a whole website? Just like most unix commands, IPFS also accepts the parameter <code>-r</code> for running the command recursively. Let&rsquo;s say our website is in the public/ directory. If we run <code>ipfs add -r public/</code>, it will first add all the files and subdirectories into IPFS, and finally give us a hash that represents the whole folder.</p>

<p>Other people can view your website with that hash. The hash changes if you update your website, but you can solve this issue with IPNS. IPNS basically allows you use a private key to update the contents of your files. As long as you have your private key, you can publish updates to your IPFS website.</p>

<p>If you want to use IPNS <em>(you probably do)</em>, you need to run <code>ipfs name publish &lt;the hash of the folder&gt;</code>. After doing these, you can give your IPNS hash to people, and whenever you update your website they will see the updated version as well.</p>

<p>But as a person who has keeps losing private keys, I can just use my domain&rsquo;s DNS records to change the hash whenever I need to.</p>

<h2>Using DNS for IPFS</h2>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t want to deal with giving out long hashes to people, IPFS allows you to use your normal domain as well. To do this, you need to add a line to your DNS records.</p>

<p>Just go to your domain&rsquo;s DNS settings, and find where to add a TXT record. In the content, you should write <code>dnslink=/ipfs/&lt;your hash here&gt;</code> or <code>dnslink=/ipns/&lt;your hash here&gt;</code> depending on what you use.</p>

<p>As an example, you can access my blog from <a href="https://ipfs.io/ipns/gkbrk.com">/ipns/gkbrk.com</a>.</p>

<h2>Hugo Specific Fixes</h2>

<p>When you are hosting your website on IPFS, one issue you should be careful of is <em>relative</em> vs. <em>absolute</em> links. If the linking is wrong, you will have issues when people try to navigate your website.</p>

<p>In your Hugo config file <em>(config.toml)</em>, you should comment out baseurl and set relativeURLs to true.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre class="highlight toml"><code><span># baseurl = ''</span>
<span>relativeURLs</span> <span>=</span> <span>true</span>
</code></pre></div>
<p>If there are still issues, you can fix them whenever you come across them incrementally.</p>

<hr />

<p>After all these steps, you should be able to successfully host your website on IPFS. If you do it, make sure to let me know by sending an email, a tweet or comment on where you&rsquo;re reading this from.</p></div>
